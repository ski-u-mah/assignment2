0,"From the day we checked in till we checked out, there was not a thing we could fault about this property! The check-in was swift and the receptionist was super friendly. I remember her smiling sweetly all the time as she talked. My boyfriend and I stayed 6 nights at Glad Mapo last year - although we paid an extra night of room charge to keep our luggages and to refresh before leaving for our late night flight, it was okay as we did not expect a city hotel to provide us a FOC shower room. Prior to our arrival, I sent a request to the hotel team to ask for a room on a quieter/higher floor with beautiful city view as we're there to celebrate our anniversary. I definitely did not expect anything more than what I'd requested but we were shocked that they upgraded us to a suite with a living room and huge bathroom as a surprise for us. It was a very, very lovely gesture! The room was spotlessly clean and huge with modern and comfortable interior. Water pressure from the shower was strong enough which was a + point for my criteria.The highlight has got to be this - I asked if they had an ironing board in the room and the next thing I knew, we received a room with an automatic Steam Styler machine. All our crumpled clothes came out straightened within 10 minutes. BRILLIANT.We constantly had the DND sign hung on our room door throughout our stay as we strictly do not like stranger in our room be it in our presence or not.. but the cleaner was very thoughtful. At every opportunity she saw us leaving the hotel room, she would ask if we needed to empty our dustbins in the room or if we needed more toilet rolls, drinking water and other amenities - all while doing sign languages as we had language barrier : ) Location of property was lovely - Once we stepped out of Exit 9 of Gongdeok Station, it is right there in front of the escalator. Direct train to and from the airport (be sure to check departure time through your phone so you won't have to wait too long!) and easy subway connection to many other tourist attractions!Some people may not like this but we absolutely love that this hotel is surrounded by office towers - It is so peaceful at night and there are lots of restaurants (both cheap & expensive - and the food is great!) within walking distance. If you need a convenient store, there is even a 7-11 inside the hotel where you can find cheap and good eats like korean bento boxes if you need a quick hunger fix. Being an ex-hotelier myself at a prestigious resort, I would say the level of service, room comfort, location etc. is great value for the price they charge. Highly recommended if you do not want to splurge too much on hotel. We will be returning to Seoul in October this year and we can't wait to stay at Glad Mapo again!","July 11, 2019","0    GLAD Mapo

1,"As mentioned on several reviews, this hotel is steps away from the Gongdeok metro (exit 9).The hotel itself is very nice, clean and quiet, and the staff is very friendly.There is not much touristy around the hotel, but the Seoul metro is easy and cheap.I would stay again.","June 24, 2019","0    GLAD Mapo

2,"We were pleasantly surprised when entering our room. It was reasonably priced but felt upscale because of the size and amenities. Their staff in every instance were attentive and gracious. The restaurant had a breakfast and dinner buffet that was good. The location at Gouong Doek station made it easy to access the subway system Our experience in the Glad Hotel compared very favorably to our accommodations in Fukuoka and in Shimane, Japan. The Glad was a 5 star experience for us.","June 16, 2019","0    GLAD Mapo

Our room was large and spacious, with wide windows overlooking the city. The bathroom had a large walk in shower. Service is top notch throughout the hotel. The M dining room staff is helpful, courteous and professional as well. It was the nicest experience for my first visit to Seoul.","June 16, 2019","0    GLAD Mapo

The Superior Double was very clean, tidy and most importantly comfortable!Staff was extremely friendly and helpful in assisting in check-in and out and also gave useful information how to go to the airport cause I had a flight at midnight. Thanks for everything!There is a convenience store (7-eleven) in their reception area! Note that it is too close from Gongdeok station which connected 4 line.

8,"The location of the hotel is excellent, it is reachable by the metro from the airport and is close by all the historical sites. Within the vicinity there is plenty of bars, great cafes, and restaurants. Everything in the room was new, clean, and fresh.Initially I was allocated to the room that was on the 10th floor and rather dark, however when I addressed the issue, Eric Kim at the front desk was very accommodating and swiftly and effortlessly moved me to a different room with a stunning view that was above my expectations. It made my stay at Seoul special and I would definitely stay at the same hotel again.","June 2, 2019","0    GLAD Mapo

It’s location is perfect for exploring Seoul, with Gongdeok station right by the hotel, which connects to many underground lines, including the airport Arex route.The rooms are spacious and very clean.

10,It’s at Gongdeok Station which is on the metro airport line (51 min from Incheon airport). You have to take to Seoul station to take arex to Incheon airport (45min for 9000won including 500 won deposit which you can refund at the machines immediately. Hotel is near exit 9 or 10) and you have to switch at exit 9 to other lines. The hotel is right in front of exit 9 once you exit. It’s not near myeongdong but there is a Gongdeok food street and market near exit 8. Plenty of eateries which run into late nights. There is a lotte mart if you walk further. Overall clean and comfortable hotel. ,"May 26, 2019","0    GLAD Mapo

11,"Even Proper Airlines will provide you with toothbrush and toothpaste for overnight flights, but not this hotel, not even if you call the housekeeping. So Glad Hotel Mapo has to be a budget hotel. Moreover this hotel provide tiny little cup with coffee powder, with no creamer, no sugar, no teaspoon. Shocking! Not even a 3 star standard.Housekeeping does not refill tissue paper, and does not wash the tiny little cup for you.Power outlet is limited, and some not working. This is just painfully time consuming if you have multiple devices to charge.Hotel staffs have no idea about the hotel surrounding and incapable to provide any directions.Hotel is inflexible and have sympathy to customers who desperately need to leave days earlier, they still charge you for nights you didn’t stay. This hotel is not customer oriented and not helpful.No much in surrounding. If someone needs to stay near All stops airport train station, may want consider hotels near Hongdae instead, which has more places to shop and dine in surrounding.","May 8, 2019","0    GLAD Mapo

12,"As a solo traveler, I often have to stay at budget places like Airbnbs and hostels. But, I wanted to spend my last night in Seoul at a nicer hotel and stumbled upon Glad Mapo. What an amazing surprise it was! The rooms and facilities are very clean and chic. The rooms have a wide desk with outlets for people traveling for work and also a comfy sofa like chair with a side table to eat on or do some work while watching some tv. The beds are big and very soft. The bathrooms are extremely clean and well lit. The shower space is large and the toilets are equipped with bidets. The hotel also has a 7-11 and some restaurants inside. It is also located right in front of a subway stop for easy travel and there are lots of great coffee and food shops near by. The checkin staff was friendly and helpful. My only regret was that I had a very early flight the next morning and couldn't stay longer!","May 4, 2019","0    GLAD Mapo

15,"I used to stay in glad hotel yeouido which is a good hotel, but this time I chose Mapo because of the location. The Reception staff here is not satisfied me. As a tourist when I m asking for food recommendations and directions around hotel at mid-night, I wish hotel staff can give me more information, not just reply “ you can find it on the street outside the hotel” and not willing to have further conversation is also showing off on her face. The second thing I m not satisfied is the house keeping. I do not get bottle of water refill everyday, and the house keeping is too annoying to get us out from the room to do cleaning. She asked me 3 times within 2 hrs, and ask when will I go out so she could do the cleaning... (P.S it is 10 am in the morning, not late afternoon) that ridiculous and rude.. we booked 2 rooms. One of the room is filled with odour like toilet drainages smell. Overall this is not my preference hotel, but the location is good, just 1 mins to gongteok station.

18,"Hotel is very well located in the Mapo area and is easily accessible by Airport express bus service from the Seoul Airport. The bus drops you about a 150 meters from the Hotel. Though the reception of the hotel is located on the 8th Floor but is easily accessible by elevator. Rooms are compact but comfortable. You have a number of cafes and restaurants around the hotel and also one of these is located on the ground floor. The breakfast was good. The staff is cordial and eager to help Though the forex exchange machine in the reception lounge was not working despite the hotel staff also trying their hand at it.. but no grudges as a number of banks are almost next door.. would love to stay again during my next visit in Seoul, South Korea.","March 25, 2019","0    GLAD Mapo

27,"We have stayed in this hotel twice in a span of less than a month (end of December and early January). Both stays were pleasant.Check-in and check-out were seamless and fast. Front office staff including the so-called concierge on ground floor were friendly and courteous.The main reasons why we chose this hotel because the location is right outside Gongdeok train station (exit 9) – there’s a direct train to/ from Incheon airport and tourists staying in this hotel tend to have good manners (they queue outside lift, they keep their voice in considerably low volume). The amenities inside the room are great. We love the shampoo/ body lotion range by Beaudiani, plus the body sponge. The room has UK/AU-compatible power outlet as well as USB outlet. Very good and fluffy bedding. Bed sheets and pillow covers were spotless.The hotel is safe. We came with four big luggage and sometimes we left the luggage open/ unlocked and went out for the whole day. Everything was intact.There are many eateries around the hotel. We speak hangul so it’s pretty easy for us explore the area and try some eateries, including those in small unknown alleys (there’s one super yummy and always busy kimchi jjigae place across the road/ the opposite of Mini Stop).PS: Those who are coffee addicts – there are some cafes around the hotel. But if you are too lazy to go out, there’s 7-Eleven on the lobby level. Its coffee latte is pretty comparable to those from 7-Eleven in Melbourne. ","January 10, 2019","0    GLAD Mapo

Given it’s not right smack in Myeongdong but if you prefer the quieter side this is the place to be. The quality of the bed is really amazing.

32,"Two things stand out for us when we stayed at Glad Mapo:1. The hotel is easily accessible from the airports using the Airport Railway. You'll be under shelter all the way from the airport to the hotel and back. It is also a convenient location to get to most places that we wanted to visit in Seoul. And it was nice to come back to an area that's relatively quiet after jostling with lots of people in the busy shopping areas in the city. If you want to spend most of your time in busy Myeongdong, don't stay here. Other than that, I think this is a wonderful base to enjoy the city.2. The beds were one of the most comfortable found in hotels, even better than those I experienced in some more expensive hotels. So you can be assured of a good night's sleep.Our experience at this hotel started positively with an early check-in by the friendly person at the front desk, Sunny. We liked what we saw in the room. The tea and coffee from CBTL was a nice touch as is the in-built bidet on the toilet seat.If you intend to stay here, be warned that they don't provide toothbrush & toothpaste, as many reviewers have mentioned. I don't think they provide a shaving kit too, though they may provide one if you ask. We didn't ask as I brought my own.3 things that lowered the overall rating for us:1. As mentioned in many reviews, the toilet floor gets wet after someone uses the shower. This is due to the poor design of the bath tub cum shower. This is something that can be easily rectified & I hope the hotel will do that soon.2. It seems strange to us that the hotel provides cups, tea bags & coffee but no spoon!3. The room could do with a brighter set of lights. This seems to be the norm in many hotels that we have stayed in recent times.For the price & benefits, we would stay here again.","December 5, 2018","0    GLAD Mapo

33,"The Glad Mapo is the choice to be in SeoulLocation: The location is super good: It´s located between Seoul Station and Hongik University, direct at metro station. From the airport you can take the all stop train which will bring you directly to the hotel at Gongdeok station (exit 9). You can take the metro to every destination and even a taxi from the legendary ""Octagon"" club is only 10 Euro. Room: The rooms are big and very well equiped. The shower and the whole bathroom is very nice and comfortable. The beds are very nice and i can´t remember when i slept so well in a hotel bed. Staff: Staff is friendly and can speak english (mostly)Breakfast: Breakfast was okay, very korean but yeah you are in Korea and also the european guests will find something good.

34,"Out of my stays in Korea (3 hotels in total in a 9 day trip) this is probably the best of the 3 (one of which is the Conrad Seoul...right?!?!)This is the first of the 3 hotel stay, took the airport train to Gongdeok and exit 9 and it was right in front of the hotel ground floor. Super convenient!!! And yes there is an elevator from the train station to the street level to walk to the hotel for my heavy luggage travelers!Lobby is on the upper level so you do have to take an elevator up and there is a small 7-11 in the lobby as well (double plus!) check in was smooth and seamless and was even upgraded on the house for a 2 bed room (my mistake in thinking we booked a double bed) I got a room on the 18th floor? The room was spacious for 2 guests with a seating area for coats and shoes in the front by the door. Complimentary bottled water. Bathroom is spacious for most Asian hotels standard. Definitely can fit 2 people in there. Shower had a waterfall head as well as the handheld. Toilet had a bidet and sink had enough counter space for 2 girls and their skincare! They even provide facial pads in case you forgot yours.The beds are more on the firmer side which i preferred. The desk area had a removable mirror which i used by the window-side to get a natural lighting to do make up. The curtains didnt close all the way but minor issue, nothing a hair clip couldnt solve.The cleaning staff seem to remembered us as she asked if we wanted our rooms cleaned and remember the next day that we only spoke english and asked if we wanted towels even if we didnt want our rooms cleaned.Overall, my whole experience has been great. The only MINOR downfall was there was no train directly to myeongdong and we were there a lot! But the bus came often too so we did that instead. Getting to Hongdae is easy!","November 25, 2018","0    GLAD Mapo

36,"I stayed at the Glad Mapo for six nights in October. I booked there because it was ranked #1 at Trip Advisor. The location was very convenient. We took the AREX train from Incheon Airport and got off at the Gondeok station. Walked out of the subway station walked a few meters and walked into the hotel! Everything was clean and room size was adequate. Unfortunately, the bathroom had a foul odor which I think was coming up from the sewer so I was moved from a room with a walk in shower to a room with a bathtub. The bathtub was constructed so when I showered, the water splashed on the bathtub surround and ran onto the floor so I had to stuff a face cloth near the half wall of glass to reduce the flow. Also, all the bathrooms could stand safety bars to prevent slipping. Because it was October, air conditioning was off in the whole building and sometimes it was a bit warm in the room even the ought window was opened by me. I understand many hotels in Korean turn off the air conditioning in October and don't turn it back on until April or May. Despite these inconveniences, if I return to Seoul, I would definitely try to stay there again.In the nearby area, there were many good restaurants-- the area is famous for its grilled galbi, and there were convenience stores, a super market, an economy department store, cosmetic stores, and pharmacy nearby. There was a good Italian restaurant very close by. And the front desk would exchange up to $200 per day which was convenient.","November 13, 2018","0    GLAD Mapo

38,"My husbund and I stayed here for 4 nights in the junior suite. Initially we book for the twin bedroom, but they offered us upgrad for free of charge. What a pleasent surprise. We found this place nice because of their Professional and kind staffs, clean and spacious room particular. Also we like it’s convenient location to go to the inchon Airport by limousine bus. There are serveral subway lines in front of this hotel, so it was easy to travel around. Also there is E-mart one block away, so we could go there to do some shopping before we fly out. Many restaurants and coffee shops and convenient stores in the neighborhood. Hotel’s reception(Lobby) was located at the 9th floor. I can’t say enough about how interior was tastefully done including comfortable beddings, spacious bathroom and extra toilet by the entrance, even there was a steam cleaning closet(?) installed in the living room. Overall this is very nice hotel for both business and sightseeing travelers. We would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to south korea for sure. 대중교통이용이 편리합니다. 특히 공항 리무진 버스를 타는 곳이 길 건너에 있고 시내버스 및 전철역 이용이 매우 용이합니다, 호텔안과 방 모두 깨끗하고, 특히 욕실, 침대와 시트등이 잘 구비되어 있으며 매우 편했습니다. 리셉션의 스태브들이 친절하고 체크아웃 이후에 짐을 맡길 수도 있어서 좋았습니다.호텔옆에 이마트가 바로 있으며, 뒷 골목으로는 먹자골목처럼 움식점들과 커피숍이 많이 있습니다. 전반적으로 외국인들에게 추천할 만한 좋은 호텔이였습니다. 감사합니다!","November 7, 2018","0    GLAD Mapo

40,"I hesitated to give a 5 star review, as normally I would reserve that for a true luxury hotel. Mapo Glad is what I would describe as an upscale urban traveler/student hotel. It’s new, fresh, clean and modern, with a minimalist industrial vibe. Our room on the 23rd floor had a nice view, was very comfortable, ergonomic, and quiet. There were a few minor issues though, which I’ll get to later.Two main reasons for the 5 star review: Value and Location. You cannot beat the location, its perfect for visiting Seoul. The main entrance is literally at the Dongdeok subway entrance (exit 9, btw),covered so even in foul weather you will stay dry. This gives you the 5, 6 lines as well as the Airport train. That airport train is the one you can take to Seoul Station where you can get the express train to ICN airport. Highly recommend that, and if you get there several hours in advance of your flight you can drop your bags there and check them in for your flight, skipping the check-in line at the airport (at least if you fly KAL). So you get get anywhere from there.The price is pretty amazing given the quality of the hotel and including a good breakfast. On our last trip we stayed at the Ritz Carlton, now Le Meridian. Despite the amenities there, given the price, we will come back to Mapo Glad. Pros: Impeccable location. Convenient to everything, including several restaurants in the building, many nearby, the 7-11 in the lobby, and an E-mart up the street. They have everything.Price, as mentioned is pretty unbeatable. Breakfast is good, the dining room is large and comfortable. (The new age piano music leaves something to be desired, however). Our deluxe king was excellent, especially the bedsheets. Best ever!! We wanted to buy them all, but they didn’t have them in stock, or we would have. Sooo comfortable, trust me.Cons: The bath-shower was designed by a fool. If you stand up to shower, all the water is designed to go directly onto the bathroom floor. I mean it will flood in seconds. Call and ask for an extra half dozen towels and line the edge of the tub before you shower, that will soak up the water. They are nice about this but it’s a design flaw so that’s the only solution.The lighting is too dim in the entry open-closet area. Too dark to pack or organize your suitcase there. Likewise the bathroom is too dark - no good lighting at the mirror. Should have bar lights around the mirror or the equivalent. In short, this is our new go-to hotel in Seoul.","October 27, 2018","0    GLAD Mapo

The location is very convenient, adjacent to the Gongdeok station entrance 9. The metro is literally just right at the doorstep. You need to take the lift up to lobby floor for check-in. Check in was efficient, done within 5 min. The Room is huge and clean, my boyfriend and i had the best sleeping quality at this hotel thanks to the comfortable bed. Oh and not to forget about the bathroom, i especially love the toilet bowl that come with warm seater and many other functions (not many hotel provide this kind of facilities). The bath amenities smell great too. Another great advantage of this hotel is its 24h operated 7-11 located at the lobby floor, that you can grab snacks/ drinks anytime without stepping out of the hotel. Totally recommended to stay at this hotel for 5 Stars experience with affordable price. Will definitely come back again.","October 14, 2018","0    GLAD Mapo

If you want a late night snack, there is even a self-contained 7-eleven inside the hotel lobby.

The bed was a queen-size rather than a king-size, which was unusual. The desk was small and difficult to sit at without banging my knees. The bathroom was ok and the shower itself was powerful although the shower gel and shampoo were both tiny. The corridor had a bad smell, a bit like dirty vacuum bags.All that said, the hotel's location is fantastic. You don't even need to leave the building to reach the department store, food court, and the underground railway network.

57,"When I first booked two rooms at this hotel through agoda, I didn’t realize that these two rooms would be at two different towers. We first arrived and checked in at the older main tower when we found out about this and were told to check in for our second room at the Executive tower. The lobby for the executive tower was at a higher level and it apparently looked newer and more stylish than the main tower. There were some couches to sit on even though the lobby was not as big as the main tower (big lobby but lacking seats) and I was even offered something to drink. I guess that’s where your extra money goes to, as the executive tower is a bit more pricey than the main. For swimming pools, we needed to go to the main tower, but I didn’t complain as we spent the bulk of our time exploring the Myeongdong areas for food and shopping. I also found out later that the hotel was also connected to the Lotte Department Store through an escalator at the Main Tower Lobby (a plus point during those rainy days). The room we got was a grand deluxe double rooms which were connected to each other. Each of the room was a good size, esp. if you have younger kids traveling with you. They also provided a Nespresso coffee machine. Hotel staff were also very polite and attentive. On one of our nights there, we ordered room service and my recommendation for room service is to order the Korean food (even though you have cheaper options out there in Myeongdong, but they close around 10-11, so if your stomach’s grumbling past 11, room service is your best bet). We ordered Beef Bulgogi and it was really good. For a luxury 5 star hotel in the Myeongdong area, there were close to none, except for the Lotte hotel. There was one other one that we were also considering, but it looked a bit old and further from the crowded shopping areas of Myeongdong.","June 21, 2019","1    Lotte Hotel Seoul

69,"The location is superb, close to good restaurants, close to City Hall and a short taxi ride to many tourist attractions. It’s also in the central business district. The hotel is large and quite impersonal, even on the Club Floors and at the Club Lounge. I think that’s because it caters largely to hordes of Chinese visitors who come to buy from the duty free shop – Lotte Duty Free – right next to the hotel. The rooms are small and quite dark, made even darker by the dark brown “wood” used for the dresser, desk and backboard behind the bed, and the black granite tops as well as the large black panels on the walls. The bathroom is especially strange. A largely transparent curtain can be lowered to cover the glass separating the bedroom area from the bathroom, so there’s not much privacy, and the bathtub – there is no separate shower – is perilously high. Getting in and out is truly dangerous for anyone but the most agile. And running the shower in the tub, even with the shower curtain carefully tucked in, still results in a flooded floor. I can’t imagine that it doesn’t damage the ceilings below. In short, the hotel is in desperate need of a makeover. That said, breakfast in the Club Lounge is generous, though some items are never replaced, e.g. the meat and cheese, and the evening Happy Hour is also quite generous. They also were generous providing a 2:30 check-out without additional charge.","May 5, 2019","1    Lotte Hotel Seoul

71,"1st trip to Seoul for both my partner & I after a few days in Busan. Did my research online and Lotte hotel had great reviews and seemed to be located exactly where we want to be especially being our first trip to Seoul we want to be in Central Seoul. We tend to stay on club floor for more privileges but I am a little disappointed this time. We were only allowed to have daily buffet breakfast in club lounge and have to pay if we choose to dine in main buffet restaurant which is a first in all the hotels' club rooms we have stayed in. I choose to pay more for a room on club floor for additional privileges and do not see why i should pay (again) because i want to dine in the main restaurant. That said, the food variety is pretty good in the club lounge but i would prefer to have options. Overall, the hotel is pretty on par for a five star hotel but i advise smokers to consider other hotels if you do not want to walk 150m each way to the nearest smoking 'box'... they have smoking floors/rooms but i do not like to sleep in an 'ashtray'. The hotel do not have a smoking area so the nearest point to smoke is outside the Lotte Mall which is adjacent to the hotel. Their front office, especially the staff at club check-in, are extremely helpful and friendly. Front office at the lobby are always quick to greet with a smile which is nice. All in, it has not been exceptional but it is reasonable and rooms are great sized with fabulous amenities. I am not sure I will choose to stay here again next time I visit but i recommend it if you want to be close to Myeongdong and most of the sites in central Seoul - we walked to jongmyo shrine and all the palaces!

72,I stayed on the Club floor so am not sure if all the rooms are of similar size and decor which I assume it should be. It's very comfortable with a sofa facing the TV for the couch potato we all can be at the end of the day. It's attached to the Lotte department store than has a pretty good supermarket in the basement. And it's literally a short 7 minutes walk to the Myeongdong area which is filled with shops selling Korean cosmetics and at some point also lined with food carts selling street snack food,"April 14, 2019","1    Lotte Hotel Seoul

That includes Americans unless they think you may be a big tipper, which you will not be because the service is that bad.No body understands English. Unless they see a wad of cash and then they all speak English. Complain and surprise surprise nobody speaks English. The only staff who genuinely are hard workers and attempt to be friendly are the chamber maids.

75,"Lotte Hotel Seoul was home to me and my family for good 9 days in March this year. We were greeted by superb friendly staff the moment we stepped out of our airport limousine. Attractive lobby, makes you feel warmth and welcome. It was my husband birthday on the day of our arrival. Im expecting just a birthday cake being placed in our room, added with a simple birthday card. To my surprise, they sent a group of staff, led by the Director Mr Simon Kyung-Soo Kim from the Rooms Team, in presenting the cake personally to my husband. What more can we say! Special thanks to Mr Simon Kim. Really really grateful for your assistance rendered to my twins, making this whole stay so memorable. Was really happy to be able to meet and chatted with you on our last day in Seoul. I have been telling my friends stories on my wonderful stay with the hotel and will choose to return in the future. All the best Mr Kim!Thankful to Mr Steven Park, Rooms Clerk. When I tried to carry my own bag during the room shifting, he insisted on carrying for me and explained that is his duty and pleasure to assist. When I offered him a little tip as a token of appreciation, he rejected. And yes it has been very nice chatting with you young man.

80,"I was travelling together with 2 other colleagues so we had booked 3 rooms. The rooms booked were designated as ""Club Superior Double"" and were described as being 26m2.Upon check-in we were assigned 3 rooms that were obviously much smaller than the rooms booked. One of my colleagues protested and was immediately moved to a bigger room. I had to run to a meeting and had no time for that, so when I returned I called the manager and showed him the room and my reservation which obviously described something different than what I was given. My room was about 10m2, with another 5-6 m2 of bathroom and corridor (see photos of supposed ""Club Superior Double""). I told him that this room was not what I had paid for and it was a disgrace for this hotel to defraud systematically clients in this way (all 3 of us were assigned to rooms much smaller than booked). He offered no explanation, just said ""I am sorry"" and proposed to move me to the right class of room booked. I refused as I was leaving in 36 hours and had already unpacked.I think it is shameful practice for a hotel laying claim to a 5-star rating that they treat their clients this way. A lower class of room than what the client paid is obviously provided and only if the client protests then they rectify the room assignment. In the meantime many clients get fooled to think that this is what they paid for.","March 11, 2019","1    Lotte Hotel Seoul

And the big old sofas blocking the way to the bath room. The worst part is the water shower temperature is inconsistent while taking shower, it keeps changing from hot to cold and cold to hot itself.

95,"I was overwhelmed and impressed from the moment I stepped into the hotel.Impeccable is how I would describe and expect from a 5 star establishment. From hotel staff representatives to service to amenities. We'll worth the price tag. I dropped off at the main tower lobby and someone guided me to the executive tower to hand me over to the colleague to take me to level 15 at executive tower for check in rather than left me to find my own way. All hotel staff were immaculately groomed and dressed and polite at all times. Check in reception on level 15 was like a posh living room of someone's house. They were so efficient that I barely had time to drink the tea and cookies served before I was ushered to room.I love the Dipytique toiletries, bath salt and O'sulloc bath tea provided!They paid attention to details such as providing 3 sets of dental kits and 3 pairs of bedroom slippers as there were 3 of us staying in the family room. There was a jewellery tray provided in the room safe. This level of detail very often missed out by most.The room was of a decent size since it was a family room. Bathroom was good size too.But what I found strange was the blinds to provide privacy to bathroom（glass panels) was located outside of the bathroom rather than inside.From hotel main tower, one can access Lotte Departmental store and subway underground without stepping outdoors which was handy on days when it was freezing cold. Lotte Duty Free is next door, so is the Star Avenue. Myeongdong is located right opposite, about 2min walk to Lotte Young Plaza and 5min walk to Shinsegae Departmental store.Unfortunately I did not use the gym or pool facilities nor ate at the hotel restaurants so I cannot comment.

Beds are comfortable. And, if I were to find something wrong with it, would be the fact that, trying to set the right water temperature, while taking a shower, at any time before sunrise, is extremely difficult; in most instances your choice will be either really hot or scalding hot.All in all, it’s a great luxury pick to consider if visiting Seoul.","November 23, 2018","1    Lotte Hotel Seoul

Terrible experience. You can keep your luggage with them as well.","May 16, 2019","2    Prince Hotel Seoul

112,"I had a tough time getting the ideal hotel in Seoul.- some quote low but give you a single room, or room without window. ( standard run of the hotel room means room without window)- lowest rate often is for small double bed, we need two separate beds for comfort.After booking and then canceling ten times, I finally got Prince.It just in the other side of the road from the Myeondong (md) Street might Market, but a short walk across the zebra crossing gets you there. It is also quiet.Roomd are medium sized but larger than most rooms in Japan. Clean and comfortable.Service : thankful that staff speak English, and can give instructions. e. g. Airport bus, where to but Tmoney card.Food : did not eat any meals there, but I noticed that there's is a small cafe on the ground floor that serves food.Overall a very suitable hotel for us. Subway and bus stations right in front, and airport bus 6015 a few metres away. Needless to say, the md night market and shops just across the road. ","April 13, 2019","2    Prince Hotel Seoul

There is a metro station right outside and an airport bus stop. The hotel is clean and quiet and the staff were friendly and nice. I knocked off a point due to their shower. The room was newly renovated but the bathroom was poorly designed. It didn't have a drain on the floor but the shower door didn't close all the day so the shower water could flood the bathroom floor.

There is also a Paris Baguette near the hotel which services good sandwiches, pastries and cakes.Access to the hotel is so convenient. If you do not have a lot of luggage, take the train from the airport to Seoul station and change the train to Myeongdong station and use exit 2 ( stairs) or 3 (escalator) and it is just a 1 min walk from there. If you have heavy luggage, i would suggest the airport hotel shuttle bus 6015 or 6001 which stops just across a street from the hotel and you just need to cross the street and there is a traffic light.

It is also the most convenient hotel to stay in since its location is 5 steps away (literally) from Exit 2 of Myeongdong Subway Station where most tours pick up point is.

135,"The room of the hotel was nicely furnished and we had plenty of space for 3 people. It looks exactly like the pictures found on its website and travel sites (e.g. Agoda). Staff were friendly and helpful. However, do note that toothbrush and toothpaste were not provided in their rooms. The only complain about their room is their air-con system - it automatically shuts off and on. When we clarify, we learnt that their air-con system has a function of detecting the temperature in the room. If the temperature of the room is higher than what is on the remote, the air-con will turn on. Likewise, it'll turn off when it gets cold. This makes it hard to adjust to the room temperature. The hotel is located conveniently right outside Exit 2 of Myeongdong station - and is directly opposite the Myeongdong Shopping Street. It is also opposite the Airport Bus Limousine pick up point which was convenient for us when we head to the airport on the last day with many luggage. Personal Suggestion: Exit 2 does not have any lift from the train platform to street level. Hence, if you are carrying a lot of luggage, I would recommend taking the airport bus as there are quite a few flight of stairs at Myeongdong station. However, airport bus is more expensive than AREX (the bus cost KRW14,000 for one way to Incheon Airport).","June 7, 2018","2    Prince Hotel Seoul

No need to worry about food and finding basic essentials, there is a seven storey Daiso shop beside the hotel.Receptionists are very friendly and accommodating, always greet us everytime we passed the entrance. Concierge also very happy to help with luggage. We can store our luggage before check-in or after checkout at concierge. Two elevators operating, took no time for us to wait since the property considered low rise and had small number of rooms per floor.Room is clean, about 20sqm, equipped with TV, fridge, hairdryer, all amenities in bathroom, bottled water, kettles and round table with chairs. Only problem came when room got very warm and we tried to turn on the AC, it blows heat fan instead of cool fan, very annoying and after we asked from operator, turns out they control all the AC from central. There were some lights not functioning as well when we arrived so we asked the cleaning lady. In shower room, also got a problem with drainage but they quickly restore it.

One of our room has king bed, and the other one has 3 single beds. Even the restroom is spacious! The only thing I didnt like is they limit water delivery in the room.

145,"After debating between Prince Hotel and Nine Tree hotel we are extremely happy to have settled on the Prince Hotel. The price was great and room was spacious. If you are looking at the picture on reviews and websites there is a flight of stairs but dont worry there is a side entrance up a slight incline for convenience. No need to lug stuff up the stairs! The hotel is across the street from the 6015 airport bus Myeongdong stop. Right downstairs is the Myeongdong metro stop. And a bus stop that many buses come through are also right down the street. (One night we took the metro to Dongdaemun and then the night bus back. The night bus dropped us right off across the street!) There is an 8 floors high Daiso a few doors down and also a 24 hours convenient store. McDonalds is about 2 minutes walk away, Tous Le Jours and Paris Baguette is also nearby! When you look at the map you will see it is across from the main thoroughfare of Myeongdong main street but this is actually one of the pros. You do not hear any of the street noise or no need to walk through crowds of people just to get to the metro stop (this is especially important if you need to get to and from the airport bus; you don't' want to drag luggage through those crowds). I've stayed at other locations directly inside Myeongdong where I had to plow my way through the crowd to get to the metro or bus stop. And where the noise from the crowd and street vendors was actually bothersome. We stayed at a Twin Room C. It had 2 twin beds, a small table with 2 chairs (so helpful when you buy street food from across the street and want to enjoy in front of the TV), refrigerator, bathtub, big screen tv, 2 free bottled waters daily, great closet space with plenty of hangers. Bathroom has essentials but need to bring your own toothbrush! No slippers either. Staff was average. They weren't all warm and bubbly but they got the job done. They always said hello when we returned. When we checked out they were very willing to keep our luggage no fuss no hassle. Just be careful when you wheel it down the small hill as it can gather momentum fast and you are on a main road! Overall I am very glad we booked this hotel and if the price is right we will definitely stay here again!","March 11, 2018","2    Prince Hotel Seoul

They dont seem knowledgeable, very much dependent on the internet to get you answers (which we have done also but we thought the locals would have a better idea, apparently not). Gave us direction according to the internet, but could not explain why one option is better than other. Another occasion, gave us the wrong station to drop off and we had to figure out the way from that station (it was within the vicinity but not the nearest) and we had to walk for more than 1 km. The last straw was, my hubs dropped (or stolen he wasnt sure) his set of cards (T-money cards, the room card and some small change). we told the front desk.

153,"With my girl friend, stay here for 10 days in September. having a break while we go jeju.Pros:1) So near to seoul myeongdong when its just a traffic light away, quiet and yet to the busy shopping street2) the bus stop for the klook pick up is just below the hotel so convenient 3) We got a corner room and it was so comfy and great street view. 4) The front desk staff were amazing, during one panic night. when my trolley lock malfunction, the staff came up to room and help. And bring down to the mechanic. And its solved. Was so relieved!!5) Its super near to the giant daiso and a convenient mart which has great friendly staff6) Also near to a porridge shop which is down the street opposite the daiso directionCons:1) Have to crack my head at this, maybe the ramp that leads to the hotel is kinda steep to pull the trolley. And this is a extremely small con point","January 3, 2018","2    Prince Hotel Seoul

159,"We chose this hotel because it could accommodate our family (2 adults and a teenage son) into one room rather comfortably. The location is PERFECT for us. The MyeongDong Metro station exit is only about 30 metres from the door. There is also a large DAISO budget store less than 50 metres away. Eateries and shops are all around and the street market is just across the road. If you are signing up for one of the day tours, many of them will have their pick up point just outside the hotel. The Seoul Tower cable car station is also only a 15 minute walk away.Getting there was easy as the Airport Shuttle Bus dropped us off just across the street. We arrived early (around 11 am) and were pleasantly surprised that our room was ready. It was a corner L shaped room which gave us enough space to put 3 single beds. The room was clean and the staff were courteous and helpful. In terms of decor, it's a bit dated but definitely still presentable.

The room itself was smaller than I expecting basing on the photos I have seen, but nevertheless it was enough space for 2 people. The room was clean and felt clean. The bathroom and the toilet was separate which was a good thing. The bed was soft yet firm enough for back support. The pillows, however, were too soft for my comfort. There was a blowdryer but no flat iron. ☹ There was not enough storage space, we had to put some of our things on the floor. On our second day we utilized housekeeping but when we came back, I felt like nothing has changed at all. Bed was made up but the clothes I left on the bed was hanging on the headboard. Due to this unsatisfactory cleaning, we didn't ask for housekeeping on the following days. The best feature for this hotel is really its location. Myeongdong shopping area/street is literally just beside the hotel. Easy access to the Metro, with only 1 minute walk to the Myeongdong Station which is located in front of the hotel. Also the bus stop for the bus going back to Incheon airport was also a 1-2 minute walk from the hotel. Lots of shops, bakeries and convenience stores nearby.

But you know what? Even though it bothered me at first, the hotel and the room are pretty great. First of all, the bed mattress got the perfect firmness. The sheets were clean, the room was clean, and the bathroom/shower is just amazing (Japanese toilets are a fun adventure :)). Wifi is free and blazing fast. And you can take a bus shuttle to the airport for about $20. The staff was terrific and very helpful, and the view is spectacular. But this is not the most important part. The most important part is the location of this hotel. It's five steps away from the Myeongdong station and two steps away from the Myeongdong shopping/market area. The location is phenomenal.

The hotel is strategically located near the airport bus (6001 or 6015 drop off Myeongdong Station), and that sort of won me over my other choice Solaria Nishitetsu Hotel (you have to drag your luggage thru a crowd for 6 minutes or so to Solaria). We had a Family Twin on the higher floor (it’s a mere 21 storey less 2 floor counts!) – the size ain’t impressive and it gets to be a problem once you stay longer than 3 nights.The music in the lift is awful - please fix that! The front desk’s service in my view is uneven; some hits & misses. Sometimes a bit of panic when there are situations to manage (I have rudimentary knowledge of Korean and noted the conversation). The housekeeper (they rotate their duty) is at times forgetful, and misses replenishing things (forgivable, given the traffic). I’m not sure if I would return for my 4th stay in 5 years and would be on the lookout for fresher newer hotels.

The breakfast room/restaurant lacks adequate facilities to keep hot foods hot and cold cold, a little concerning, would not pas a Finnish health inspection. Hot foods to be kept at the minimum of 60 degrees centigrade and cold at +2-6. Here everything is luke warm, even the salmon.

The bathroom had a big walk in shower with high quality shampoos, body washes etc.The three lifts which served the hotel's upper floors were responsive and fast.My only gripe was that the bar and lounge on the 3rd floor (reception) was never working , the bar attached to the restaurant (2nd floor) would only serve drinks if you ordered a meal so the only place to get a drink was the 21st floor rooftop terrace where the cheapest drink was a bottle of Spanish beer for 18, 000 won.

It is clean & very neat property.The location is great and close proximity to Myeongdong shopping area and Lotte Department stores & also to Shinsegae departmental stores.

199,My mom and I decided to splurge and stayed in this hotel for a week. We were warned that staying in Myeongdong that long might get crowded and overwhelming but we absolutely loved it. This hotel had every amenity you could ask for. The decor is beautiful and the staff is very friendly. In this hotel we truly felt like we had a home away from home. The beds are incredibly soft and great quality comforters. I would trade my own bed for these beds any day. And the hotel is close to everything. Hungry at 3AM? Walk 5-10 minutes to the many street food restaurants open all hours. Take out some gimbap and go enjoy it in your comfy room. I really can’t say enough good things about this place.

The Airport Limo bus stop is 500m from the hotel as well.The twin room which the hotel allocated to me (level 15) had a fabulous view of the Namsan tower.One negative point is the elevators are extremely slow, but notice that all elevators in Seoul are very slow, so perhaps that's normal.I really enjoyed my stay with the hotel, will definitely choose L7 Myeongdong Hotel again on my next visit.","November 6, 2018","3    L7 Hotel Myeongdong

204,"Great choice if you want to explore the heart of Seoul. The hotel is modern and funky with a superb view of the N Seoul tower. You couldn't ask for a more convenient location- shopping, food, corner stores, street food, a department store directly across the road and most importantly ideally located for the 6015 or 6011 limousine buses from Incheon international airport. The Seoul on/off bus stops right beside the stop for bus 6011 so touring the city is as easy as it gets (both airport bus stops are literally a 1 minute walk from stop to the hotel front door). The optional included breakfast was money well spent and they give you vouchers that you take to the hotel restaurant. The nice thing with that is that if you have an early flight or day trip and will miss breakfast you can use the vouchers as cash within the hotel. Knowing that drinks at the roof top bar were expensive and that we'd miss a breakfast due to departure time, we used a few vouchers to offset the drink price.Staff were very attentive, polite and and willing to answer any question, and yes the front desk and concierge were fluent in english.","November 4, 2018","3    L7 Hotel Myeongdong

205,"I stayed at L7 Myeongdong for 5 days-4 nights on September 2018. I enjoyed this hotel because of its location from Myeongdong underground shopping, bus tours, subway, and other transportation. It is also steps away from the famous Myeongdong shopping areas and street food. Everything is accessible and I loved walking around the areas surrounding the hotel. I reserved a twin room and it was small but just enough space for two people sharing a room. The bathroom was tight with glass door shower. This hotel was cool for they have many outlets in their seating areas so for gadget lovers you would love how the hotel thoughtfully placed their power outlets all across the room. The laundry room at the basement was a hoot learning but does the job and I appreciated its availability for the guests. The hotel's coffee shop Angels-In Us was really good to get your caffeine fix. I enjoyed that spot a lot. The cafe Americano was strong and fits my taste. Overall, I will stay at this hotel again just for the location alone and coffee.The reason I am not giving this hotel a 5 star review is because of two things: the housekeeping was not attentive during our stay. Our room was clean most times but there were also times as if the cleaning was sub par and half done. Pls L7 work on this issue! cleaning should be standard for any 4 star hotel. The other thing that irked us was the hotel's restaurant Villa de Charlotte. While waiting for our check in time and our room to be ready, we decided to try their lunch buffet at the hotel. Bad idea! worst buffet I ever signed up on.The restaurant charged $28-30 dollars per person when their food trays are almost empty and what was left were just chicken and french fries. I didn't know if this restaurant knew the concept of a buffet? meaning the food needs to be replenished right away before the food trays are empty. We stayed at the restaurant for an 1 hour or so, even then the food trays were left empty. The experience was no longer a buffet but more like HUNGER GAMES. Pros: Location! nothing can beat it. Power Outlets everywhere in the room, well designed rooms, coffee shop, steps away from Myeongdong underground shopping for a Kpop lover this was heaven.Cons: housekeeping needs to be more attentive, Pls stay away from the hotel's restaurant overexpensive buffet. Go outside the hotel for meals that are more satisfying and cheaperHelpful Tips: pls do your reservation early this hotel always get sold out. If you are requesting for an early check in, don't expect it because majority of hotels in South Korea are strict with their check in times.. Pls try the Congee House right next to the hotel, it was such a satisying treat.","October 31, 2018","3    L7 Hotel Myeongdong

211,Hotel is centrally located within easy walk of underground.Room are fairly spacious and modern.Breakfast offers a wide variety of hot and cold food. However don’t wear flip flops or open toe sandals as you will be turned away. Found this quite ridiculous considering it’s a hot climate and the informality of the restaurant.Beautiful Sky Lounge bar on top floor but be warned that it is the equivalent of £10 for just over half pint of larger. Also cannot charge to room account. I had to go all the way back to my room and get cash.We had three separate reservations as our plans changed and we booked extra nights. However the hotel was not willing to marry up our reservations and made us check out and in again. On the last reservation we were clearly given an “old” smoking room as there was a stale smell in the room.Asked receptionist for advise on shopping but was provided with in accurate information.,"September 25, 2018","3    L7 Hotel Myeongdong

Airport limousine is just outside too, so it couldn't be easier to get here from the airport (and back again).Location - MyeongDong is quite a touristy area, but a great introduction to Seoul for shoppers. Plenty of skin care products and street food on offer. You won't struggle to find food or drink on your doorstep. The room we had was a decent size, and had coffee and water provided and replenished each day.There's a good TV with a range of channels in various languages, and you can plug a laptop into it and watch Netflix using the hotel's speedy free wifi.We didn't use the restaurant, and the bar on level 3 wasn't available during our stay.The rooftop bar is very trendy and has prices to match. One beer was 14000 KRW (about £9) and the food was very expensive also. Good for a special occasion but not for your evening meal everyday.Bed is very comfy, and the bathroom had a good shower. Toiletries and hairdryer also provided.Not many negatives.

216,"I booked this hotel for 3 nights stay. When I checked in, there is no service such as assisting the luggage, induction of the hotel, or even leading you the way to the lift for going upstairs. The location is great as lots of shopping malls and local stores around as well as great restaurants, easy transportation to go everywhere. \The room is in good size but there is no full body mirror in the room, this is the first time that I stayed in a hotel which does not have that. I didn't check the breakfast as they didn't upsell to me anyways. During my stay, I turned on the ""Do not disturb"" but still the housekeeper knocked on my door for couple times and I have to let her in to collect towels.Their check out time is 12:00 and I called them an hour ago before my check out time just as politely to let them know I may be a bit late but will check out asap which the operator just rejected my request. When it was 11:50, not even the check out time, the housekeeper knocked on my door again which I have turned on the ""Do not disturb"" button. So I guessed staffs in the hotel dont really care about that button at all. It is actually very rude as it is not yet my check out time. The lady keep telling me that I have to pay if I stayed over 12:00, excuse me! I have called the operator already, so please communicate well within the company!Last thing is that I wrote some post cards and would like to get the stamps, the receptionist told me that I can get the stamps in the ArtBox which it is a fault information as they didnt sell stamps there at all. = =... I went back to the hotel and asked them if they can help me shipped the post cards (with stamps on) already. This is the first time that the hotel rejected to assist placing the post card and deliver for the customers. Also, they just rejected without providing solution, for example, telling you where you can just drop off the post card as it is a Sunday, post office has been closed.Anyways, my conclusion is that there are lots of hotels in Korea.

It s one of the worst service I ever receive from a hotel .1) on March 31st around 8-9pm the hotel deactivated our room access card and checked in our room to stranger customers. The people were able to access our room and walked right in!!! Most ridiculous mistake ever. Both the trainee guy and lady manager on duty had poor English or maybe they pretend to have poor English as it seems like they didn’t want to be responsible . Simply wanted to brush me off by saying sorry end of case. Luckily my korean friend called them to makeup for their mistake, the next day to compensate they upgraded the room.2) overall the staff needs stronger training and service attitude, nobody cares about customer or helpful. Even asking for a trolley to help ourselves with luggage the counter said they dunno how long the other customer will use it for. Very passive and reluctant to give any sort of help, end up seeing the trolley at lobby with no one informing us it s available .3) Breakfast is bad and very little options, they barely even refill.

But the afternoon after leaving the hotel for Japan, I noticed bites all over my torso, back, shoulders. There are raised red bumps that if you research bedbug bites, are identical. They sting and are itchy and I can't go to the onsen bc others would be disturbed. Such a bummer to encounter this. In the states we have The Bedbug Registry which is very useful when booking hotels. You can check to see if any were reported before you book. I emailed Ocloud hotel as soon as I discovered this but have not heard back. Nothing. This is terrible bc bedbugs will ruin an entire hotel or apartment if they are not caught early. Judging by the sheer amount of bites on my body, these bugs were numerous and hungry.

226,"Pros are like what the other reviews mentioned - location and price. Bed is comfortable. However, the stay was not as comfortable. The air condition fan was not adjustable. It kept switching on and off through the night. And it’s a loud and strong fan at that. Kept interrupting sleep. No basic amenities like tooth brush and tooth paste provided. The front desk could be a friendlier and more helpful - requested him to see if there was an available room just one hour before check in time and his response was a straight up “no”. Finally the lighting in the rooms and hallway are all white light making the place rather cold and sterile. The toilets are already white tiles and fixtures, felt like a hospital. Will not recommend this unless you absolutely need to be around the area. ","July 23, 2018","4    Ocloud Hotel

227,"Stayed 4 nights in the Ocloud Hotel (Room 1311) and for the price paid it had everything you could need. Best of all it was a great location. Set back from 2 main roads, it had easy access to the metro around the corner, which has an express train to Gimpo Airport and also connects you via transfer to Seoul Incheon. The hotel was a few streets away from Gangnam metro station and right in the heart of the Gangnam neighborhood which has shopping, restaurants and constant action!

The roof garden is overgrown and unattended - the gym room is very private , not much equipment, but fine for good work out . Once you get the hang of it , it is a clean and stylish hotel !! Good location , clean and well appointed , tastefully decorated rooms - well worth the money ! The lobby has a Youth Hostel vibe , but the rooms are great .

243,"We stayed at Ocloud in 2015 and thought it was unbeatable given the price, location, and the size of the room! So it was a no brainer to pick this hotel again on my past trip.Unfortunately, this time the experience wasn't as good. The first room we got had a weird smell... Smelled like... Dogs? Maybe because the AC wasn't on and no one stayed in that room for a while. When asked for a room change I waited 15 mins and no one came so I had to call again. (Maybe because it was Korean Thanksgiving so they were low on staffs?) They gave me another room 2 doors down and it was much better... Still smelled a little but to be fair I am quite sensitive to smells. My bf said he couldn't smell anything. The bedsheets are kind of dirty too... They were washed but with stains. We asked for a change of bed sheet on the second day but the new one still had stains on it. We did not ask them to change it anymore but surprisingly on the third day we didnt ask for new sheets but it was changed into one with no stains LOLHaving said that the location and price is really really good... Paris Baguette (My fav ) is literally a 30 sec walk from the hotel, there is a mini food area right around the corner and a larger food area within 10 mins walk. Subway station is only a minute away if u take the short cut through the office building so if there are no other newer hotel in the area next time I visit I would probably stay here again :) ","October 18, 2017","4    Ocloud Hotel

270,"This location was steps away from the hustle and bustle of Myeongdong, which we enjoy. Getting to the hotel was simple by airport bus limousine, which drops off very near the hotel entrance. You go to the same spot for pick up, no reservations necessary, just check the schedule that's posted. We had a triple room with comfortable mattresses. AC worked well and could be adjusted as needed. The bathroom was spacious and clean. Shampoo, conditioner, and body wash were provided in wall mounted dispenser. The hotel provided a lounge (24hrs) for guests which offered self-serve water, tea, coffee (hot/iced), comfortable seating, and tv. This was conveniently located next to the washer and dryer nook. Washer/dryer were large capacity and powerful. There is a machine selling laundry detergent in the nook. It only took one round to dry all the clothes. There is only one washer and dryer. Free wifi is provided throughout the hotel. In addition to the comfort of the hotel is the great location. As soon as you walk out of the hotel, you're surrounded with stores, restaurants, street food vendors which stay open late. We really enjoyed strolling through this area late at night with the crowds of shoppers and having our hotel only steps away. I would definitely stay there again.

The room's amenities may be minimum but it is definitely very clean. We're always greeted in the morning by a smiling housekeeping staff along the corridor which is a great way to start the day!The front desk staff are also most helpful with directions and requests that we had during our stay. One of the most commendable staff would have to be Alice who remembers her guest's name but also went out of the way to assist us. As we had a very late flight out on the day of check out, we requested for a late check out as we would like to take a fast shower after a half day tour that ended at about 2.30pm. We understood that the hotel was facing a fully booked situation for the room type that we occupied. Instead of rejecting us outright, Alice took the initiative to check with her manager and got us a single room for us to wash up and refresh. (which we are most thankful for)I would say the hospitality we experienced at Nine Tree Hotel was way beyond my expectation.

325,"We stayed for a few nights at the Lotte World Hotel and had an overall wonderful stay.It started off a little rocky in that they my name mixed up with someone of a similar name from Russia, but we were able to get it worked out.The service overall was amazing. One anecdote: I had forgotten to pack my ties and didn't realize it until 6am on the day when I had to give a presentation at a nearby medical conference. Although there's tons of luxury, duty-free shopping nearby, nothing was open that early in the morning. As such, the concierge (Mark Shim) took off his own tie and let me borrow it for the day. It was a ""give you the shirt off my back"" moment. He definitely went above and beyond the call of duty on that one.Other aspects of the hotel are that the lobby area is nicely appointed and likely recently remodeled. The only downside was that the rooms are a bit dated and could use a remodel (at least the one that we were in).It has a fantastic location since a major subway station is right there (the Korea subway system kicks butt and is better than all the other ones I've been on including Japan, NY, Paris, London. If you have kids, Lotte World is in the same building and don't forget to check out the Lotte Tower across the street. 123 floors and the view is amazing. 5th tallest building in the world and also has its own Lotte-affiliated hotel.We would definitely stay here again when we return to Korea. It's a great place.","June 1, 2019","6    Lotte Hotel World

335,"...unfortunately we were a couple. Nevertheless, I picked the hotel for it’s convenience to Gangnam and other areas south of the river. Was very convenient in the freezing winter to be dropped off by the KAL Limo bus from Incheon Airport at the hotel’s doorstep, and to access the subway via the underground connector under the hotel. Getting to the malls and the Lotte World Tower was a breeze too, sheltered from the cold.Hotel was traditionally furnished, but very well maintained for an older hotel. Room service is has an excellent selection, although one of the highest priced I have ever experienced - eg. USD 25 for a club sandwich. Service was very efficient, effective and professional, although lacked warmth - but that’s typical of Korean service. Would recommend and a great option if you plan to stay in the area and spend time at the surrounding malls. Otherwise this modern area lacks the more interesting Seoul culture that you’d otherwise get in MyeongDong.","January 20, 2019","6    Lotte Hotel World

343,"I've stayed at this hotel for quite a few different occasions. While traveling for business it was close to the places I needed to go, and I also came here with my family as well. I can't help but criticize the room accommodations. First of all the only power outlet is a strip next to the TV instead of near the bed. This means all of your tech needs to charge there and you will need to part with your phone unless you have a 10' cord. The linens in the rooms are very old, and you can see the wear and tear. Above all they are not even very soft. The towels are so rough I wouldn't even use them to wash my car. The bidet on the toilet is also very odd. It doesn't exactly fit the toilet itself and you can see the seat is not flush with the actual toilet. The trash bin next to the sink is also very strange. There is no trash bag, the bin itself is wired, and if you throw away contacts or qtips it would just hit the floor. However there is a tiny black trash bin looking thing next to the toilet that is hard to aim into. Also getting a taxi is very inconvenient. I had one case where I went to wait at the taxi line, 30' to the right of the main entrance with a taxi placard, but had people walking out of the lobby snag my taxi before I had a chance. The employee was not paying attention to me until she already sat the other customers into the taxi. After I gave her a stare she walked over and apologized. I think she just wanted to stay in the shade instead of actually doing her job the right way. On the bright side this hotel is surrounded by convenience. You have the subway and bus terminal about 5 minutes from the lobby elevator. A huge selection of food in the basement, the department store, and across the street in the mall. The aquarium and Lotte world is also a 5 minute walk. Anyone traveling with children would love it here. The new Pororo land inside Lotte World is an amazing playground for toddlers. Overall if you're coming with children this is a great hotel, but remember you're paying the high price for convenience not the room amenities.","September 28, 2018","6    Lotte Hotel World

366,"My wife and I with 2 young kids stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in late December 2017. The staffs were friendly and well-experienced.When we booked this hotel, we thought that it is located in Lotte World. Lotte World is a 5-minute outdoor walk from the hotel (South entrance). Alternatively, you can also reach Lotte World indoor via the Lotte Shopping Centre/Lotte Mart, but will take you about 15 minutes. The Lotte World Aquarium is also located in a nearby building, which is a short walking distance from the hotel.There is also a complimentary hotel shuttle that runs to Lotte Hotel Seoul in Myeongdong and other nearby tourist sites such as Insadong and Itaewon.The Concierge desk is very helpful with arranging tours. We wanted a private tour to play snow sled, which they helped contact the tour company.There is a KAL limousine bus that comes to the hotel. But note that the bus stop is located outside the hotel at the street level, and not at the hotel's parking lot. It can be quite cold during Winter if you have to wait for the bus.I would recommend this hotel to families with young kids as the location to Lotte World and Lotte Aquarium is very near.

I listed some pros and cons below:Pros:- Housekeeping always made sure to keep the room clean. If any additional requests like towels or slippers are needed, they would help immediately. Also flexible on when they can clean your room simply by asking them.- Two bath robes are provided in the room and can have them changed everyday on request. A lot of hotels these days don't seem to provide a bath robe, or only one.- Room slippers are changed everyday along with basic necessities like shampoo, shower gel, toothbrush, etc.- Coin laundry with dryer on 8th floor to get quick laundry done.- A very small and quiet gym also on 8th floor that doesn't get utilized much so feels very private for exercises like yoga.- Guest lounge at lobby has 2 Macs (actual Mac and not Windows) to use along with good couches and free tea.- Hotel can hold all your luggage during pre-check-in or check-out which is definitely helpful.- First floor cafe attached to hotel has a very lively environment, with a special wedding-like decoration on weekends.- This hotel is located nearby 3 different subway stations which means there's 4 different subway lines you can get around the city. Each station is about 5 minute walking distance. Very centralized location!Cons:- The surrounding stores and neighborhood feel very old, need to walk a bit to feel modern.- Constant constructions in the area- No traffic light in front of hotel and require to look both sides and hope for the best to cross across, literally frog hopper- The gym is not for weightlifting as there's no dumbbells or benches, just yoga mats, bikes and climbing?- The computers at business lounge 8th floor (where gym is) are very old, Intel Pentium chips.

The shuttle bust and the rooms are just simply wonderful !

The first part of our trip, we stayed 5 nights in a standard double which was pretty large. The buffet breakfast which had a pretty good selection of items was included in our price. The best thing about the hotel was their courtesy shuttle that took us to most of the popular spots like the Myeong-Dong, Insa-Dong and Dongdaemun Shopping areas,the Namdaemun Market, the Shinsegae and Lotte Dept Stores, The hotel was close to two of the local train station stops. They have a coffee shop and bakery on site and a convenience store just outside the hotel. They also have a coin laundry on the premises as well as a business center and fitness room. On the second part of our stay, we booked a balcony deluxe twin. Unfortunately, this room seemed older and the balcony didn't offer much of a view due to all the construction going on in the area. The beds and bedding were very comfortable.The staff were all very friendly and helpful and there was always someone who could understand enough English to provide assistance. The only negative would be that when they have a wedding there, the coffee shop would be closed because the weddings seem to take place there.

401,"I stayed in PJ Myeongdong during my first visit to Seoul and it was a pleasant and joyful experience, the hotel was clean, the rooms spacious, the beds comfortable and the staff were cheerful and helpfulThe fact that Myeongdong shopping street is only few minutes away is a big bonus I will definitely stay there again ","May 4, 2019","7    Hotel PJ Myeongdong

402,"Not worthy certificate of excellence. Not even near it. Don’t get fooled by the rating thinking you making a good choice. Why? I will tell you and show you why.Short versionBad locationBad cleaningUnprotected Wi-FiNo luggage serviceBad surrounding areaBad soundisolation and very noisyMostly Chinese tourists, they seem to like this hotel.Free drinks are not drinks but coffee, not even tea is ok!A lying reception, first they don’t provide AC, then AC is not working, then it suddenly works (turned on by hotel).Long version.Let me start by explaining that this hotel is not in the tourist part of myeongdong, not sure it can be considered to be in myeongdong at all? That is why they offer shuttlebus service because walking to the touristspots takes 20 minutes. But the tall Korean guy with glasses in reception did not even mention the shuttlebus service to us upon arrival. Instead he gave us the room closest to the construction side with lots of noises. There is constructions going on around the hotel, mostly on the east side and a school also. That means lots of noises and early also! I knew they had lots of empty rooms because I booked same day, so I asked the same guy for another room. He lied saying they don’t have any but I insisted they had and was given another room. This time with a non-working AC. When I told him the AC is not on he said we do not provide AC. At that point I was really angry been lied 2 twice by the reception upon arrival and not offered any good service at all! I showed him the email of my confirmation and hotelpage saying clearly there is AC in the rooms. So he replied that it is not working. Later he called our room saying it will be on in 1 hour. What happened was that he didn’t want to turn the AC on. Just like he didn’t mention about the shuttlebus and gave us probably the worst room in the hotel. Neither did he offer us any help to get our luggage up to the room or transfer it to the other room. Instead he asked us to get down our luggage before changing room then go up with it again. Congratulations for winning the price, worst hotelreception I encountered among hundreds of hotels I checked into in over 25 countries!The cleaning is not done well and the hotels has no password on their Wi-Fi. That means anyone with little skills could steal your passwords while you use their Wi-Fi. Very stupid not adding a simple password to their Wi-Fi. It does not cost the hotel any money.The area around the hotel is not so safe or nice in any way. That is another reason why there is shuttlebusservice offered from the hotel itself for free. To compensate that extremely bad location.There is hardly any soundisolation between the rooms. We complained several nights about noises from the other room because we couldn’t sleep. Not much happened after complaining. If you are a hard sleeper then maybe this won’t bother you. But paying over 100 dollars you except to be able to at least sleep in your room nighttime.I don’t know if I got an overpriced room due to late booking, but this hotel rooms are not worth more than 30 dollars a night. Sure the front of the hotel looks modern, but the insides seem stuck in the 60s. Just look at the pictures I uploaded. Noone should pay more than 30 dollars for what they get here. My advice is not to stay at this hotel at all; there are so many other options with better locations and better value for your money in Seoul. Don’t be fooled by the certificate of excellence that this hotel is not worth at all!We were offered free drinks vouchers through our booking company, turned out these were only useable for coffee, nothing else, not even tea!Just don’t make my mistake, don’t waste your money on this hotel when there is many better options. And always check the reviews carefully, who gives high ratings now that it is so easy to create profiles, give a high rating and do it over and over again. Not every certificate of excellence hotel is worth its ratings. This is the second time I encountered such a hotel, but this was is so far the worst hotel I stayed at compared to its price, value and what you get.","April 22, 2019","7    Hotel PJ Myeongdong

403,I made a reservation here and need to cancel the reservation. I made 2 attempts and have received NO contact. When I made contact to inquire about something unrelated before my cancellation they responded very quickly. Now I am nervous they will charge my credit card. They don't offer a 1-800 number either.

Definitely recommend, the staff are helpful.Only thing that could possibly be changed is the option for early check in - it was a short wait, but a lot of other hotels did give up the option.All in all, wonderful hotel, definitely would come back !","April 7, 2019","7    Hotel PJ Myeongdong

405,"I stayed here last week for a total of 5 nights with my mom and 2 sisters. The rooms were big, beds were comfy, interior design looked like a typical 4-star hotel. The staff can speak English and were very helpful. We arrived around 8:30am but there was no rooms available so we were only able to check-in around 2pm.The hotel is located in an industrial part of town, surrounded by stores selling customized/corporate notebooks and stationery. The surroundings were bad and it was really weird to find a 4-star hotel in the middle of that area. Nothing to see in the immediate area, it wasn't clean. If you're from Metro Manila, the best description is that it looks like Tomas Mapua or Aranque or Soler in Binondo! Haha!Anyway, the good thing is that it was quite easy to hail cabs from the hotel and if you take a cab from somewhere, the cab can easily drop you off at the hotel's doorstep. The hotel is also 5 minutes walk from the Chungmuro Station from the front of the hotel, or 5 minutes walk from Euljiro 1 (I think) station from the back (we only used the Chungmuro Station). The airport bus stop is also in front of the Chungmuro Station exit. There is a bakery at the hotel (but not very good) and a CU convenience store at the ground floor.I think it is still walkable to Myeongdong, which is where all the shopping is - probably 10-15 minutes walk. They have a free shuttle that goes to Myeongdong every hour, as well as other key places like Dongdaemun and Kwangjang Market. It is very helpful as it saves you money for public transport. My sister loved this but I didn't because I didn't want to be tied to the shuttle's schedule. We missed it a lot of times so we had to wait another hour for the bus. By our last day, we just took cabs everywhere we went.The first day we checked in, the water bottle in my mom's room was opened already. We complained and they changed it and apologized profusely for it. The next day, the mugs were left uncleaned in the bathroom but the rest of the room was cleaned. Again, housekeeping was contacted and they apologized profusely and replaced the mugs. It was weird. What I can commend is that they responded quickly and fixed problems quickly.This was my sister's 2nd time staying at PJ and she really recommends it but I won't recommend it. I would prefer a hotel inside Myeongdong. However, it is a good value for money hotel because it is 4-star, clean, huge rooms, very good service. I just didn't like the inconvenience of its location. So it's a ""so-so"" hotel for me overall.","April 3, 2019","7    Hotel PJ Myeongdong

Rooms are very quiet with a central control panel on nightstand that controls Lights, temperature, and communications. Also the toilet has heated toilet seats.

When we walked into the hotel lobby we were satisfied with what we saw. Unfortunately, when we arrived to our room it was a different story and we were extremely disppointed. The room did not represent the photos shown online, seemed outdated and the entire room had a foul odor to it that made me nauseas. It was so awful we didn’t even end up staying one night and found another hotel for the remainder of our trip.

414,"This hotel is located right in the middle of two metro stations - Euljiro 3-ga and Euljiro 4-ga - both just 5 minutes walk away from the hotel. The area surrounding the hotel may not give the best view as it's situated in the middle of a commercial district with lots of small workshops (definitely not in the tourist belt).We stayed in the twin room with a balcony in November, which turned out to be a godsend what with the Korean preference for a little over-heating their interiors. Just leave the balcony door open for that cool autumn air to keep the temperatures a little more pleasant (no, the thermostat wasn't working in our room).Overall, a nice stay. Rooms were clean and beds were comfortable. The self-service laundry room was very welcome (just have a couple of 5000 won notes handy for the machines, and detergent packs from the vending machine cost 2000 won). Having two convenience stores less than 50m away from the hotel and ATMs on the ground floor was also great!","December 12, 2018","7    Hotel PJ Myeongdong

416,"We booked this the ladies only option room for 6 nights as opposed to standard room as it showed as room with foot massage, Nespresso machine and hair straighteners provided. While the room was nice enough, only the foot massage was available. I was told the Nespresso machine didn't come with pods, if you wanted to use the machine we had to buy the pods from reception. We looked all over the room for the straigteners but again, not available. There was daily room service but no one noticed there was no straighteners. The other strange thing was, even though it was advertised as floor was Ladies only, there was def males coming out from that floor.The hotel itself was nice enough, very convenient with the free bus shuttle and near 2 different subway lines. Its advertised as Myeongdong but it's still a good 10/15 mins walk from the Myeongdong shopping area but this wasn't the only hotel in the area that advertised it as Myeongdong so maybe an extension of the Myedongdong but def not the main shopping area.The nearest airport limousine stop is exit 8 Chungmuro station line 3. Buses no 6001 and 6015 stop there. 15,000 won each way. As soon as you get off you see Kia Cars then an alley way and then Paris Baguette cafe. You walk down that alley way all the way to the end, roughly 3-5 walk and hotel is across the road.","November 27, 2018","7    Hotel PJ Myeongdong

One guy came but didn’t help us, and we left the luggage near the elevator. Then I went to receptionist for check in, she was even more rude then him. She didn’t say hello or anything. The whole process of check in was so uncomfortable that I got upset. At the end, instead of giving me information about breakfast and other things, just weaved with hand that I should walk away. Then I got very upset and asked her what kind of hotel this is, or someone going to help us with luggage. Then the same person helped us with luggage with very rude manner.When we got in the rooms, not by far the standard, shown in the pictures. Smell was coming from the bath rooms and old type with plastic curtain in it.Then during the check out another receptionist, again not polite and when finished with checkout, instead of saying anything, just gave me look that go away. Same person helped us with luggage during checkout with same rude attitude.

Furthermore the hotel provides free shuttle buses (one toward Myungdong and the other toward Dongdaemoon) many times a day.

432,"There are so many great hotels in Seoul, it’s hard to truly rate them. Often times, it just comes down to location. Nestled in an uniquely green part of the city, the way to the Shilla hotel was really beautiful - winding through a beautiful tree lined driveway. There’s also a traditional building in the center of the compound, which was unexpected and quite interesting. It is also a big tourist attraction as it is attached to their Duty Free store, so can be crowded and chaotic in the lobby during peak hours. Nevertheless, service was great, very consistent throughout my stay. Rooms are very spacious, though a bit dated. Overall recommend, but would suggest location as key decision factor.

My room was spacious and featured all the amenities that a traveler from the USA could want - from Edison based outlets to a kit of tech cords to automated blinds and lights and a very sophisticated toilet! It seems as if the hotel was designed by travelers for travelers which is so greatly appreciated after a long haul flight from the States. The staff are totally on point and at your service and plentiful - you see staff supporting throughout the hotel including at the front desk helping manage the check in/out and concierge lines.

The freshly stocked buffet lines went on forever and featured everything you could imagine from local delicacies to our creature comfort go-to traditional breakfast options. The male hosts seemed a bit stressed about the seating in the dining room area (ie we asked if we could sit at a table where a diner had just left with his bags and a male host nearly had a breakdown which was odd) - otherwise the entire staff were very pleasant, accommodating and available. I had a dinner in the dining lounge on my arrival night and all tasted great. The conference rooms are stellar and in a gorgeous setting in what looked like traditional Korean buildings. I would return to this hotel in a second.","June 12, 2019","8    The Shilla Seoul

435,"The rooms, spa, restaurants...have been renovated (I stayed here few years back). The service is excellent, the staff is outstanding. The breakfast buffet may seems expensive but definitely worth it, same for their lunch buffet (high end price) but again the quality and incredible number of foods worth the price. The bar has live music (jazz, classic,...) in the afternoon until evening. Nice cocktail and wine list but little pricey. The hotel is 40 min by cab (no shuttle bus available) from Gimpo International Airport which I personally prefer to Incheon airport. The hotel is 5 min walk from a subway station.I have two (small) negative remarks: in the past their spa was offering high quality traditional massage and scrubbing. I tried their new fancy Guerlain spa which is very expensive and I was not impressed by their service. They should bring back their traditional Korean services at least for non Korean customers who don't really care about Guerlain french spa :) in Korea.My last remark is that despite being one of the most important hotel in Seoul its extremely difficult to get a taxi from the hotel after 10:30 pm you have to wait 15 min even more until a taxi comes to the hotel. Very strange! good market opportunity for Uber :)But again a top five star hotel. Will definitely come back","May 11, 2019","8    The Shilla Seoul

456,"I used to be a fan of The Shilla Seoul in the past but my last stay just became a big let down so I will not be returning anymore. What I like about their hard product (my past stays include all of their room types: superior, deluxe, executive and suites) is their bedding (one of the softest in the industry), the bathroom and the amenities in the room but the decor, the size of the room and everything else are just average. The rooms are on the smaller size in general with low ceiling in comparison to the newer hotels that opened up in Seoul. Where this hotel used to excel really well was the service - every staffs you interact with will make you feel genuinely cared for and respected. What lacked in hard offerings were all made up by the quality of hospitality. I remember the staffs going above and beyond to ensure my family/friends and I had a wonder stay whether it was in-room service, the urban island pool, restaurants, front desk, etc. I also remember sending a sincere gratitude e-mail to one of the managers for the exceptional service provided at the pool. The Japanese restaurant has one of the best sea urchin dish that I kept on going back for (no longer offered) and the executive lounge does actually offer decent food and beverages, enough to make you stop by to enjoy the offerings (unlike many other hotel chains offering bare minimum enough to deter from making an intentional stop). The breakfast spread and quality is one of the best in town but also, the most expensive breakfast offering in town. On the other hand, the 3 Michelin starred La Yeon happened to be a disappointment. The dinner was just nothing memorable and the flavor for almost all of the dishes - underwhelming and bland. The reason why I would never be returning is because in my last trip, the hotel repeatedly let me down by not providing the room type requested ahead of time (they prioritized group tourist over me), refused to honor room upgrade voucher (not asking the reservation staff at the time of booking was the reason per the staff), refused to provide additional toiletries (stating one per day so if u happen to use the whole mini bottle by taking a bath...well, you are out of luck), additional charges for 2nd person for 2 twin-bed room for breakfast (make sure that the correct number of person is selected when making the reservation even though at the time of reservation up to 2 person doesn't change the price anyway), and then trying to recover the situation after making one after another complaints. By the way, this hotel will never give out the name and the contact information of the general manager for the guest to communicate directly (I guess only VIPs get access to that person?) All in all, it seems like this hotel is becoming too crowded by group tourists and I guess less revenue generating guests are simply treated with lesser importance. I would definitely take my business elsewhere as it lost its charm.","September 16, 2018","8    The Shilla Seoul

Busy as usual the team still paid attention to detail so that I was still well taken care of after my check-out with access granted to the spa before I took my taxi to Incheon.

462,"Recently stayed at the Shilla under an AMEX FHR booking. Got all of the stated benefits even though the hotel was quite packed. It's summer in Korea so local hotels are crowded with staycationers and one of my nights was a Sunday.The hotel was extremely busy on Sunday. From entering the front gate to being dropped off at the lobby, it took 15 minutes. A 1 1/2 hour wait for a table at the lobby lounge. Service was slow and inattentive at that lounge. Once the dinner buffet opened, there was a line of 50 people waiting to get in. Was quoted 100,000 won per person to use the outdoor pool but when I went to check it out, I was told they sold so many packages that I probably wouldn't be able to use it. I've been to other Seoul hotels on weekends but there's so much going on at this property (duty free shoppers, weddings/events, people coming for restaurants, hotel guests) that it's very hectic (the lobby in particular).The property was much more tranquil on the weekdays. Room service was very fast. Although the breakfast buffet was very crowded, the staff was very attentive and professional. Front desk staff also friendly.At the end, I give the Shilla a ""very good"" rating on TA. The reason being, it's still one of the top 5 hotels in Seoul but no longer the very best (my vote goes to the Four Seasons).","July 20, 2018","8    The Shilla Seoul

Also the service was very good and everybody was very attentive and helpful. My wife and me wanted to chill at the outdoor pool one evening for less than an hour and we heard that there is a fee of 60.000Krw (approx USD 60) per person. We argued that this was not indicated anywhere and we were guests of the hotel that the pool must be free of charge as we have never experienced this on any continent in any hotel in the world. They let us in and we got lounge chairs by the adult pool which was forbidden for children under 13 years. However, the pool had tens of screaming kids with their parents which is fine for us but not if it is supposed to be an adult pool!It seems Shilla is selling some Pool packages to outside guests, but please change this for guests staying at the hotel as it is expected that Hotel guests have full access to all the pools.

The hotel stands on a stunning green beautiful landscape and a grand exterior.Rooms were very comfortable though not the most luxurious among the 5 stars. In fact there is a broken tile in the bathroom which I wonder why was is not replaced as it was a loose floor trap tile.Otherwise we enjoyed stunning view of the mountains and the Seoul tower with comfortable beddings and the standard 5 star bathroom equipments.Staying in the executive business deluxe rooms allow us the access to the lounge which provides real quality food (breakfast, snacks, afternoon tea and cocktail) and service and a well equipped gymn plus a lap pool. Generally service staff are very helpful and polite but business like that results in lacking in personal touch and warmth.The hotel is not near any places of interest.

The in-house Chinese restaurant is my family’s favorite place to go have Peking duck. In addition, you will never look at jajangmyeon and tangsuyuk the same way after eating here. This hotel also happens to have the best quality duty free shop in the city in my opinion. Just expect the usual army of Chinese tourists who shop here in droves. But once you get over that (if you can), then this place offers quality name brands to shop duty free. ","May 11, 2018","8    The Shilla Seoul

475,"We just checked in at Shilla hotel Seoul. Since we arrived early in the morning (8am), they didn’t have a room ready so we were asked to wait until 3 pm. We wanted to make a reservation at the Guerlain spa while waiting and asked the front desk staff if that is possible but he responded, “I don’t know. You will have to go upstairs yourself to check the availability.”I mean... Why is it not possible to check it at the front? We asked again and he responded back saying “so you want me to make a call?” in a pretty rude tone. Am I asking for something impossible? He insisted he can’t make a call or make a reservation because the room is not ready and we don’t have a room number. Huhhh? Why can’t we just give them our credit card and charge it to the room when it’s ready?I asked to speak to the manager, she came out and called the spa and the spa didn’t have availability til later today. That means, if we had gone upstairs to ask ourselves, we wouldn’t have been able to get in anyway, so why was it a big deal to make a simple phone for the guest? Mmmm.

When I checked into The Shilla, I had no idea that my mind was about to be blown away.South Korea is NOT known for having quality English speakers... Although you'd not know that if you'd only been to the Shilla. The majority of the front desk staff speak such excellent English I wondered if they had some sort of exchange program.Additionally, there are several that speak accentless Mandarin Chinese!The happy staff, from the doorman that refuse tips, top the bell hops, to the cleaning staff... Just fantastic.The spa is wonderful... Gotta go try. Next time I think I'll stay an extra day.The bedrooms... Perfect design. Huge flat screen TV, with a medium sized table, couch and a chair to sit at and watch... Plus a desk and desk chair.A king size bed with almost too many pillows. Air conditioning will go to whatever temperature you want.A bath tub and a separate stand up shower. The shower has the hand held wand as well as the RAIN shower head in the ceiling, and the water pressure is FANTASTIC, and the water temperature gets as hot as you want. A toilet with three Japanese style accessories.. From heated seat, to the bum gun bidet, to a light that goes on at night time helping men see where to aim! Automatic window blinds... A swimming pool outside (for use in summer) which apparently ous the best in Seoul... I'll find out I'm sure. Top floor business club...I brought some of the soap back home and my wife loved it (she normally throws it away saying poor quality).Live jazz off the lobby every night, multiple restaurant options.

We were always greeted when we arrived and left the hotel, the concierge desk was extremely helpful on several occasions, including helping us with a minor medical issue. I would definitely recommend this hotel for both a personal stay and for those doing business travel. It is located on a hill which offers some nice views of the area and also provides some ""built in"" exercise when you walk to the surrounding area. We booked a Business Deluxe Double room - which has King size bed, a sofa and chair, and one of the largest big screen TVs I have ever seen in a hotel room. Everything was very well maintained and well appointed. We found the room to be a great value. The one comment I offer, and this is not a complaint but an observation, is that the services in the hotel - restaurants, lounges, bakery, etc. are quite expensive, which was a surprise given the value of the room. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend this hotel to those visiting Seoul.","March 26, 2018","8    The Shilla Seoul

488,"Im told Myeongdong is the #1 tourist destination in Seoul. Maybe. If so, then this hotel takes the sweet spot. Its just along the fringes of Myeongdong so nights wont be chaotic outside, but just really close enough to let you dive into the streets. Repeatedly. Its also just a few minutes’ walk away from Euljiro-1 train station, and from there you can get to most anywhere in Seoul. If that wasn’t enough there's a scheduled hotel shuttle that would take you to Dongdaemun and other areas.Check in was smooth and relatively quick. The hotel has a modern feel to it. The room is reasonably spacious for a family of four. There are a sufficient number of electrical outlets, but most are of the type peculiar to the country. Better check your device chargers to ensure they are compatible. In-room wifi can be spotty at times. Sleep quality is good, but at times the airconditioning can get a tad warm.Breakfast buffet is served in the basement. Not very much in terms of variety, but thankfully the food tasted great. If you tire of the pickings, theres plenty of restaurants outside: A Starbucks just downstairs, Mos Burger, a McDonalds a street away, a 711 just in front of the building, and an Isaac's about a block or two away.

Our booking included complimentary breakfast and late check out but the breakfast is very dismal (terrible coffee, basic choices like rice, soup, bread. The only fruit was oranges. By the way, plenty of 24 hour korean restaurants around that would serve better food so you wont miss out on much!They have a coin operated laundry on floor B2 which would be convenient for longer stays. We also liked that they had hot/cold water dispensers on our level and on the ground floor. No need to keep buying water at the convenience stores (for those picky about tap water).Location: EXCELLENT. 3 minute walk to the green subway line and also the airport bus stop. And literally steps from Myeongdong shopping and restaurants.The room: we were in a twin room on the 12th floor. It had a fake window that did open but opened up into a fake garden that has an overpowering room freshener smell - probably due to the smoking room nearby. Our room was non-smoking. Bathroom was good sized and shower was great. Basic amenities (shampoo, shower gel, lotion). There's a TV in the room. We requested for an iron but the ironing board was broken. The room is also very hot and stuffy we so basically left a room key in the slot to keep the power on and blasted the AC. Even then, it was only marginally better and the air is VERY DRY.Overall, fine for 3 days ... everything we needed for a shopping weekend in Seoul.

BUT on our first night of the second time, we faced a big problem. While the outside temperature was -7 degree Celsius at 1.30 a.m. but, the temperature in our room was 28.5! (When we came here the first time, it was in January 2018, we got a room with proper window but this time our room has a window that opens to an indoor garden, which didn't seem to be useful at all.) It was suffocating and we were sweating and couldn't sleep. It was so bad that I had to go down to talk to the staff at 1.30! and all the staff could do was telling us that the hotel is operated with central heating/cooling system, and there's nothing we or they can do to make our room cooler. Their only advice was to turn off the heater (in which we did, but it didn't make any difference at all, the temperature in the room still fluctuated between 27 and 28.5 degree). In the end, the staff gave us an electric fan! Believe it or not! We had to turn on a fan while it was -7 degree outside! And the result? I got sick the next day because of the unnecessary heat in the room, the breeze from the fan, and the sleepless night. We had to endure it the whole night and the next morning, I asked and was able to move to the room with the proper window that opens to outside world. It was better but I was already disappointed and I wish the staff could be of any better help, as we had to pack our bag and check-out of our old room before 12, and had to come back at 2 to check in to our new room.

We asked them to book a tour for us, call our cab driver on the last day and they were always willing to help when we ask for directions. Everyone knows english and is very friendly. I also liked the fact that the hotel provided a space in the lobby to repack your lugguage if required while waiting ..there was also a scale to measure the weight of your lugguage which was very thoughtful of them. It was very helpful to know how much your own lugguage weight was on check-out before flying home so you could have time to repack if required!Outside the hotel there are a few restaurants too..and convenience stores and currency exchange places which was very very convenient. Definitely I would stay again if I come back to Seoul, highly recommend too for anyone who is looking to stay close to Myeongdong!","February 23, 2019","10    Pacific Hotel

All amenities are located outside ie. foreign exchange, 7 Eleven & a 24 hour Korean bbq lolWe were in Gangnam only 2 weeks before and it was shocking although it was suppose to be in a rich area! Only downside to this hotel is that check in staff are not proficient in English so be patient with them.

Prior to out visit, we had some email communications w the reservation team and they were v prompt with their replies.We had such an amazing experience with the front office too. A shout out to Min, he was so patient with our queries on how to go about in Seoul. Min explained us in details. The only downside is that there r only few English tv channels. We just download Netflix and watched via ourPhone as their wifi is excellent.Pacific is very near to Myeongdong subway station and also eateries. Two minutes walk away from halal eatery too, Kampungku. The airport bus shuttle is only across the road abt 3 mins walk. Cross over n u will see Northface boutique n walk a bit u will see the hotel.

Pacific Hotel is near to Myeongdong Exit 3 (with elevator). You just need to cross the street to the main Myeongdong shopping area. The hotel is also surrounded by convenience stores, and restaurants. Our favourite BBQ place (On the Grill) is also just 1 minute walk away. More importantly, the airport shuttle is also just across the street. Hence convenience is top here. Perhaps some might prefer to stay in the heart of Myeongdong, but our experience here is far more superior. We stayed in the family twin room (level 3) - new, modern, just renovated, clean and comfortable. Facilities wise - there's everything you need, from small refrigerator to all the amenities. In fact, we have nothing but positive comments regarding the room. There is a washroom at the Level 3 lift lobby area, which is good where at times the toilet in our room is occupied. The common area is also sparkly clean. Lastly, service is what makes Pacific Hotel the best hotel in Myeongdong. We interacted with many of their staff throughout our stay and they are always friendly and willing to help. They speak good English too. Raining? They will pass you an umbrella. Moving your heavy luggage? They will approach you quickly to help you with your bags. Need help with directions? They will search and advice you. They are more than happy to hold our luggage before our check-in dates (because we travelled out of Seoul), and are always prompt and helpful when we emailed them when we make our reservations.

Our family of four stayed here for five nights last week and enjoyed our stay.Pros: great location, just take the subway underground shopping tunnel to enter the heart of shopping in Myeongdong across the street. Easy to find, in front of the Seoul Tower if you get lost walking around. Friendly front desk and valet who kept watch over stored luggage. Recently renovated hotel, rooms looked nearly new. They accommodated our request for two rooms near each other made months in advance and they secured rooms next to each other on the seventh floor. Quiet rooms, didn't hear any street noise despite facing the front and no noise from neighbors. Some minor hallway noise. Very clean rooms, friendly housekeeping staff.Cons: wifi strongest at off hours late at night or early mornings, slow during the late morning and early evening. Think this is a businessman's hotel but not cool that the pool and spa is only for gentlemen. Breakfast not included in our basic rate, not a big deal as there are coffee and pastry shops, 7-11, small supermarket and McDonald's within a block.

But honestly, I should have cancelled and book something near Seoul Station instead of myeongdong. Service is zero. Only one lady staff can speak average English and is thus helpful. The rest have quite mysterious purpose and presence here. I don't know why they are standing around and getting paid.Tourist who wants to learn about history of Korea should stay here as the thinking they have in this hotel is prehistoric. Only men can use their hotel gym and sauna. Ladies who book here should demand a discount for being denied our rights to use hotel facilities.Upon checking in, my Friend asked if this is a sleazy hotel. Bathroom glass wall and door are transparent. I was so ashamed of a bad booking. Worse - bathroom door is faulty and it takes them 3 days to repair. They didn't offer us ladies a change of room (prob since we're not men).Sound system is bad. We heard our Neighbours moving around their room all night.

The shower cubicle was enclosed in transparent glass with a venetian blind to block the view, which did not give complete privacy.","May 23, 2017","10    Pacific Hotel

591,"We've been here before for a quick Layover almost two years ago. We really liked it at that time for its nice rooms (got a free upgrade at the time) and the great location.So after nearly two years we came back....this time for a week. We booked a room with a kingsize bed, which was - especially for Korea - a good sized room. Facing the front with some views of the streets of Myeong-Dong. Even it is a busy area, the room was perfectly quiet.Check-In was fast and friendly, the staff overall very professional and helpful. The room had everything we needed. Fridge, nice shower, really comfy and big bed. And a fantastic toilet with more buttons and functions than Cpt. Kirks chair on the Enterprise. All the lights, ""Don't Disturb"" signs and other functions work by an array of buttons on the alarm clock....in case you don't find the light switch at first glance. The room was perfectly clean, from the floors to the bed to the toilet. There is a mini-fridge with some stock....but still some space in it to store some drinks you might wanna buy from the mini markets just out front (we preferred the GS25 to the 7-11). Flatscreens and free Wifi in all rooms as well. A coffee shop and a restaurant are downstairs. Pretty good coffee if you need some in the morning.Location couldn't be better. The subway is only a few steps away, getting you pretty much anywhere. The shopping district of Myeong-Dong is really just across the street....busy until around 11pm daily. With some great dining options.But the best dining option is actually just besides the Hotel. It's called ""Myeongdong Jungil Hoegwan"". But there's not english sign. But you can identify it by the phone number on the entrance door: 2-777-3770. There's a similar restaurant just next to....be sure to choose the correct (right) one. If you like Korean BBQ (and meat), the this is the place. Nothing short of brillant! Just on the left when you leave the Hotel.Behind the Hotel is also the Namsan Park and Seoul Tower....the cable car station only a 10' footwalk away. Shinsegae Dept. store and the Namdaemun market are also only about 10' away by foot. So, location-wise you couldn't do any better.All in all a fantastic stay. There's really nothing to complain, great staff, lovely room, perfect location. And all for a reasonable price. Highly recommended!One more thing: The Airport Shuttle Bus (15$ each) stops just across the street.Wanna know more about me and my trips? Check my profile.","April 29, 2017","10    Pacific Hotel

I did very much impressed to the set breakfast I ate last year which was high quality and delicious. For this time they changed to breakfast buffet BUT the choice is MUCH less and frankly the quality is below average. In my opinion, it is not worth to pay extra for this breakfast buffet.

599,"My wife and I traveled to Seoul on April 9 until April 16 and stayed at L7 Hongdae. The hotel is located in the heart of the Hongdae area and is only 100m from exit 1 of Hongik University Station. Reception is located on 21st floor with guest rooms on the 5th up to 20th floors. On the 21st floor (other side of reception) is the restaurant and also guest lounge which has ample seating to chill out, catch up with friends, play pool, read a book (they had a selection of books available for guests) and play vinyl records (also selection available for use by guests). There's a bar and swimming pool (pool is only open during summer months) located on 22nd floor. The breakfast buffet was very good with a good selection of eastern and western dishes, as well as fruit and pastries, which were all delicious and well worth including in your booking. The staff were always courteous and very helpful (when my wife sprained her ankle, they were great and sent up some ice to help keep the swelling down). Hongik University Station is one of the stops on the Airport Express Rail, so it's easy to get to from Incheon or Gimpo Airports (from Incheon it will take about an hour on the all-stops train). There's plenty of good eateries (cheap ones as well) in the Hongdae area as it's predominantly a university area and during the evenings there's a huge population of students milling around in the area eating, browsing or buying things (as well as doing performances in the area opposite the hotel). The room we stayed in (1612) was great - comfortable bed, big windows which could be opened if you wish to, bidet-style toilet (with heated toilet seat), large shower with raindrop shower and a vanity mirror that never steams up!!! Unlimited wi-fi for the guest who needs to be always ""connected"". We would definitely be staying at this hotel again and have no problems recommending it to anyone else.

The hotel is 100m walk from Exit 1 of Hongik University Station, meters away from numerous restaurants (there's a seafood restaurant, Indian restaurant and cafe in the same building), as well as it's own restaurant on 21st floor and poolside bar on 22nd floor. There's self check in at the front desk located on 21st floor with guest rooms located between the 5th and 20th floors. If you're considering staying at L7, I recommend adding the buffet breakfast option which includes a good choice of Eastern and Western styles, including fresh fruit. There's a guest lounge on 21st floor which has a view of Hongdae area. The lounge includes a pool table, vinyl record player with some records you can use, and plenty of comfortable chairs to use for reading (there's a small selection of books available) or to watch the world go by. If you're an Argentine tango dancer, you're a short walk from several milongas.

We had trouble while self check-in due to the format of our booking name, and the lady at front desk quickly solved it for us. 服務員都很專業和友善，我們在自助 check-in 時遇到困難，前台的一位女仕很快便替我們解決了問題。Breakfast on 21/F was okay, foods and coffee are good only they have not many varieties.位於 21 樓餐廳的自助早餐不錯，食物和咖啡都很美味，只是菜色選擇不多。This is recommended to choose rooms on upper floors if street noise will easily disturb your sleep.如果你也容易被街上噪音吵醒，建議你選擇較高樓層的房間吧！We will certainly stay at this hotel again when we next visit Hongdae.下次來弘大我們也會考慮住 L7 Hongdae 的。","March 16, 2019","11    L7 Hongdae

605,Loved the L7. As dusk fell over Hongdae we would quite happily open a beer and gaze out from the huge windows in our room at the city as the neon lights blinked on. Just minutes later we could be in the middle of the melee trying street food and listening to the karaoke wafting over the busy streets. The room was adequately sized with a comfy bed and a table and easy chairs with a good bathroom. The common areas of the hotel are very cool but it can be a little style over substance. The rooftop bar was expensive and we thought it was a shame you couldn't have a wine in the lounge area near the reception which was larger and cosier. As such we found nicer bars elsewhere in Hongdae. Breakfast was fine but the buffet choice was a little on the meagre side. The metro is just minutes away with central Seoul about 20 minutes away with Gimpo 20 mins in the other direction.Would definitely return.,"February 5, 2019","11    L7 Hongdae

607,"Room was reasonable sized with full length window view. Amenities met basic hotel expectations & hotel design was hip and funky. Location was very prime and easy to find. Located opposite the main Hongik shopping area & a McDonalds, nothing to complain about. Traffic can get a bit noisy (Koreans do seem to like to sound their horns quite a bit), however the noise tapers down a lot after 12/1am. Toilet comes with a bidet, a saviour during the winter season. Receptionist staff were conversant in English but displayed general low comprehension skills (they can provide instructions well & clear, however unable to respond to questions/often misinterpret them - for e.g. asking for time to check-in & they may respond with a ""yes/no"" conclusively - does not actually answer the question). Not an issue as I can speak some Korean however may be an area of concern for non-Korean speakers/tourists. Staff do display typical behaviour of awkward language however I am aware English is not their first language.Observations: Male staff were generally not very hospitable. They do not greet any hotel guests and if possible evade eye contact. The men tend to respond curtly and do not smile at all. Slightly strange for a Lotte establishment (established hotel chain). Female staff were much more approachable however both genders displayed low English comprehension skills.General comments: Despite great location, the reception is located on the 21st floor. Lift algorithms were strange and you often see long queues of hotel guests waiting to either check-in & check-out or guests trying to return to their rooms. Average lift waiting time is 4-6 mins.Request higher floors for less traffic noise & ability to get into lifts from the top (poor lift algorithms mean that lifts may open doors to full lift cabins if you are at lower floors).","January 9, 2019","11    L7 Hongdae

608,"Depending on which room you stay in, be prepared for a horrible experience at L7 Hongdae. There is construction currently happening on the 21st floor. If you happen to have a room on the 20th floor and want to either sleep in late or work in your room during the day, you are going to want to find a new room.Other minor annoyances: -English speaking is not so good if you have a problem-There is no one to help you with bags when you enter the hotel and you have to take an elevator up to the 21st floor to checkin-Checkin doesn't feel warm at all as people help you work through checkin on a touch screen-While walking in the hall, a cleaning lady slammed me in the face with a door. Since there is no way for her to see outside of the door, I can't blame her but it didn't feel so good anywayAfter traveling the world for many years, I can safely say this was by far one of my worst hotel experiences of my life. The only upside was a room upgrade after complaining a second time about how bad the noise was outside my room.Advice to management: Please state that there is construction going on and that there is an extreme amount of noise on certain floors. A good example of a company that does this well is Disney.While my new room is pleasant and I appreciate people accommodating after insisting to talk to a manager, I would steer clear of this hotel at least until they finish construction or demand a room that is not close to the 21st floor.","December 13, 2018","11    L7 Hongdae

It had a floating bed, large TV, large showers and bathroom, and a centre island sink. The view was amazing and i was facing the city and could see the busy streets in Hongdae. The gym is modern and spacious; however, i did not get to experience the outdoor rooftop pool because but it was closed for the season. Furthermore, the hotel is extremely convenient for travellers as it is situated only a few minutes from the green subway line and steps away from multiple bus connections. The hotel is also just two small streets away from the busy restaurants, night market, and shops that Hongdae is famous for.

The size, view, lists of TV channels, bed, laundry room, water dispenser, easy check in (where you just need to key in the details in computer-self kiosk) and easy check out (just drop the key at the box), almost everything. The location is strategic; nearby train stations, lots of great coffee houses, walking distance to many restaurants and shops.However, what made my stay more memorable was actually I fell sick during my trip. So badly sick but somehow it was on public holiday, and most of the pharmacies and clinics were closed. I made a call to the front officer with the intention of asking direction for the nearest pharmacy. That was it. And to my surprise, the team (front officer and security guy) went extra miles by checking me the next day, in front of my room 1st thing in the morning just to make sure that I'm fine. They even got a taxi ready just in case I needed further assistance. That was truly remarkable I did not expect this at all. Kudos to the customer service team!BTW, I've already booked for another room for my next trip this coming January. This time around, I didn't even browse for other places.

619,Nice and comfortable hotel...very convenient to the subway system and nightlife around the area. Breakfast is nice but it was the same selection (stayed here for almost a month). Rooms are well kept and staff is very nice...only downside is elevator system...seems to take forever. ,"September 16, 2018","11    L7 Hongdae

620,"We stayed here as part of our honeymoon travels in September.The hotel is very easy to find from Hongik University station which is a direct train line from the airport. It is only 5 minute walk from the station.The check in desk is on the 21st floor which I thought was nice at the beginning, but by the end of the 5 day stay I could see how this was a huge annoyance as it creates unnecessary lift traffic.We were given a room on the 19th flood facing out the back of the hotel which was lovely. The front of the hotel can be quite noisy as it is a main pub/restaurant street, but he hotel provide you with earplugs in your room.The room was immaculate, very spacious and cleaned to perfection every day with fresh towels/bottles of water.Check out was quick and efficient, although when asked if we could store our luggage, the two female receptionists started laughing and just took the bags which I thought was quite rude. If you make check out 12pm, you need to allow for easy storage of bags in the hotel as out flight wasn’t until 11pm. The pool on the top floor was nice. There was only 3 other people there when we went, but it is quite small I can imagine for a very hot busy day. It is expensive, and they charge extra to have a seat and a towel which I think is a bit ridiculous. The hotel is expensive enough I think one day should be free of charge at least.We had a very comfortable stay here, but I think the hotel does need to tweak some areas a little bit, hence I haven’t given the 5 stars.","September 14, 2018","11    L7 Hongdae

621,"Cute and modern. The perfect distance from the super busy streets that are packed with energized college kids. On a main strip that has great restaurants and shopping. The house keeping was great. Security at the 1st floor where the elevators are AND you need a room key to use the elevators- perfect. The rooftop bar was a little spendy, no cocktails under 20 USD but the service was impeccable and the view was stunning. And, the cocktail, Birmingham Spring was superb. Great modern, fun, clean, casual hotel in the middle of everything.","September 12, 2018","11    L7 Hongdae

623,"I had no idea what I was booking when I booked this hotel in Hongdae. I knew I wanted a hotel at a decent rate in a decent area. The rate was approx $100 a night (which is great!) and the location seemed ok. At the end of our stay, I concluded that the value was great for what you get and the location could not be beat. This hotel is brand new as of 2018 ( i think it opened around Feb). I am curious how the hotel will hold up over the next few years.Hotel/Location: IT is located in between 2 subway stops. Right across the street from the major shopping and eating area of Hongdae. It was very convenient to be able to come back to the hotel in between shopping and eating to drop things off. Just know that Hongdae is located outside of the main part of Seoul (Gangnan, Itaewon, etc.), but is a tad closer to ICN airport. The hotel like mentioned before is very new. There is also shopping and restaurants located in the hotel. People have mentioned before that the elevator system is kinda of slow. I will attest to this, but it wasn't that big of a deal. The lobby is located on the 21st floor which is weird. The hotel was decorated in a very hip/chic fashion. Lots of cool art and decor. There is a business/play area (lobby area) that is wide open. Includes sitting area, conference area, pool table, computers, and lounge. I really like this area. At night, you can come and hang out there. View is fantastic. No free drinks or coffee to my knowledge. Is potentially open to outside guests (no need for key card to go to 21st floor). The hotel was clean throughout.Checkin/Service: They try to make checkin via a kiosk. Except the lady had to help both of us with our check in. Seemed to defeat the purpose. Keys were dispense by the kiosk. With that, check in wasn't too bad. Service overall was good. Housekeepers were really nice and quick to bring towels and whatever else you need. There is a gentleman door stairs that will call a cab for you. I did not see any bell man or valet guy.Room: Really nice set up. The basic room is not big but is spacious because there is only a half wall separating bathroom/sink area from the rest of the room. There is no closet, but enough space to set up your suitcase. We somehow ended up with 2 twin beds (not a big deal) that were comfy. There were outlets next to the bed. There were USB chargers on the desk. There is a small fridge (empty). Hot pot with cool instant drip coffee. The amenities were adequate including slippers, 2 free bottle of water, toothbrush, comb, and bath sponge. There is a separate toilet area and shower. Shower had nice water pressure. Internet was ok. Temp control was adequate. I did hear some street noise from the 17th floor. Not a big deal. I did not hear any noise from the other rooms. There was an ice maker and water dispenser on our floor. Hotel Amenities: There were a few restaurants in the hotel that we did not go to. So I cannot comment on the quality or price. There was a really nice pool (roof top) with bar area. They charge for usage of the pool. There appears to be entertainment from afternoon to evening. We went there really late and it seemed like a nice setup. I just cant comment as to how crowded the place gets. I did not check to see if there was a fitness room or not.All in all, a great hotel for business or friends. We didn't spend much time in the hotel and used it mainly to sleep. I think it was perfect for that.","August 23, 2018","11    L7 Hongdae

624,"We booked this place hoping that our kids can use the pool, and I have also confirmed this with Agoda when I called the hotline. Upon check-in and to our disappointment we were advised that our kids were not allowed to use the pool. We were also told that there are extra charges to us the pool, to rent a towel and rent a seat and you can cannot be there all day. Also, the elevators are a bit of a hassle as it takes a while to wait and sometimes it opens ON EVERY FLOOR! Anyway, those inconvenience aside, the hotel staffs were friendly and prepared to help, the facilities were modern and clean and the beds were comfy and cozy.What we love the most is the location, it is close to the train station, restaurants and shopping. Everything is within minutes walk and it was fantastic.Overall it was a pleasant stay and we enjoyed our time at the L7 Hongdae.","August 11, 2018","11    L7 Hongdae

The only negative thing is that both the reception and the restaurant is located on 21/F, so giving the elevators a lot more traffic. On the day near the check out time (also around lunch time), I had waited for more than 15 mins to squeeze in a lift.","August 6, 2018","11    L7 Hongdae

If you want a towl its still another 5dollars. And the 20dollars will only get you a segment of the day. Prepare to leave the pool when your time is up.I had a booking including breakfast.Asking for an extra piece if bread is not possible. They then come back saying it is possible if you pay extra. I have never had this experince before, paying extra for a piece of bread.The location is nice but service is very poor. The extra costs make it feel like a cheap hotel, not a 4 star one.","July 31, 2018","11    L7 Hongdae

Literally takes 10-15 minutes to wait for an elevator whether you’re on your room floor, at the lobby, first floor or on the rooftop. I’d stay at another hotel just so you don’t have to deal with the frustration, almost missed our train to Busan because we were waiting for an elevator.

630,"Had a wonderful one night stay here! Highly recommended for anyone looking to explore the Hongdae/Myeongdong area!PROS:- Location, location, location! The hotel is 1-2 minutes away from the Hongik Univ. subway station (exit 1), and also a 5 min walk away from the Incheon Airport shuttle bus stop. LINE/BT21 store is right downstairs of the same building, including restaurants, convenient stores, cafes and more just minutes away. Hongdik Uni and the surrounding shopping streets are also a mere 10 minute walk away.- Wonderful service! Was always greeted with a friendly smile by all reception staff who were spoke great English and attentively helped even when there was a crowded lobby. There are self check-in and out kiosks available as well, but the staff were always ready to jump in at anytime. Also had someone stationed on the 1F to help with doors and elevators.- Rooms were clean and comfortable, albeit basic with no closet (single hanger rack). All the necessities (WiFi, hot water, air-con) all worked fine, and all basic toiletries, hair-dryer and bathrobes also provided. No bottled water, but free water refill station on every floor.- Nice decor around both the 1F entrance and the lobby. Modern, artsy and added to a great atmosphere!CONS:- Elevators sometimes took a while to arrive. Minor inconvenience, but can get frustrating if in a hurry.- Could hear some of the road bustle near the window (even from the 15th floor) - a small price to pay for the prime location, and this did not affect our sleep at all. Super light sleepers may want to pack some earplugs just in case though!N/A:- Did not have time to use the lounge/gym/pool/breakfast, but wish I had! I believe there is an extra charge for the rooftop pool even for hotel guests.- Also didn't attempt to call a cab to the hotel as the subway/bus was just too convenient.All in all, the cons hardly affected my stay, and will definitely be back again!","June 28, 2018","11    L7 Hongdae

We didn’t eat in the restaurant upstairs as prices were ridiculous. The only negatives are there is a building site next door and across the road which woke us up most mornings. Also the pool wasn’t in use which we only found out when we arrived. Annoying as one of the main reasons we chose hotel was the pool so no swimming or relaxing for us. One final thing is there is absolutely no storage in the rooms for clothes.However overall I would definitely recommend. ","June 3, 2018","11    L7 Hongdae

All the cool places you see on YouTube about Seoul, Hongdae didtrict with its clubs and restaurants and bars; the instagrammable Giheung Line Park which is a onve trans siberia train line transformed into a gorgeous linear park and Ehwa University with its beautiful gothic buildings. There is a subway line literally 10 meters from the front door to all of Seoul.Our room was stylish and modern with an oipen concept bath that made the room seem sacious and very mod. Loved it.

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to one of the front desk staff, Miss Rella Min in particular. I checked out on 15 Apr (Sunday) and I got some postcards to mail. I found it difficult to purchase stamps in town since it was a Sunday and Post Offices were closed. No such service is provided by the hotel itself. Rella personally helped me to send out the postcards, she was willing to go above and beyond her job duties to provide extra help to guests which is highly appreciated! Thank you again for her kind assistance.

The hotel itself was stylish, they provided self check-in and check-out service, which was very different from other hotel. We enjoyed the check-in process, it was fast and easy, the staff was there to assist us for the whole check-in process. As my room was paid to the hotel directly, i could able to get VAT for my paid room charge, it was nice. The room was well equipped and comfortable, we were assigned to stay at the end of the corridor, but it was a nice room with great view, as the windows size was a bit wider than others, coz we can enjoy a private corner view with the extended wider window design. I would recommend this hotel to my friend and will certainly come back to stay.It was convenient to go to the airport by the subway from Hong Dae university station, it was cheap and easy, although there was a bit walk, around 10-15 mins from exit 1 to the airport rail line, but there was escalator and walkway all the time, no need to use the staircase, so it was not difficult to bring along with your luggage, the travelling time was about 50 mins, which was faster than taking bus to airport, and no need to worry about the traffic if taking bus.","April 20, 2018","11    L7 Hongdae

The fittings in the room are trendy and working, for eg, different voltage plugs to suit devices from varous regions. USB sockets are plentiful and some next to the beds. It is situated near Hongik University station of the Seoul metro network so no problem moving around in the city. It will be better of the glass partition of the shower tub be removed and replaced by shower curtain to prevent splashing out of tub and have a metal bar on the left side to allow safe stepping-out of tub.

653,"Stayed for 5 nights in late May and really enjoyed my stay. Hotel room was absolutely spotless all the time. My partner spilled banana milk on the sheets one night and it was promptly changed the next day after we came back to the hotel. Location: hotel is situated between 3 main train stations - Chungmuro, Eulji-ro-3 and myeongdong (all about 5-7 mins walk away from the hotel). It’s located in a quiet neighbourhood so you don’t get the hustle and bustle of myeongdong which is great but you can always pop down for a quick walk for some street bites. There is a nearby fried chicken place that is great but I didn’t manage to try :( only found it in my last day. A number of convenience stores are also located nearby making buying any snacks Amenities: they provide the usual - toothbrush, comb, tea, coffee packets etcExperience: Both the check in and out experience were seamless. They had a strict check in policy time of 2pm so they didn’t allow us to check in early when we reached (understandable). They also provided umbrella when it was raining.

I recommend this hotel especially for families since it is in the heart or seoul, so close to myeongdong shopping area and street foods. Lots of great restaurants just around the corner near this hotel. The hotel is new so everything is clean. Has a laundry area which is a great deal to us since we stayed for more than a week. I would like to especially thank Ms. Song for accommodating us throughout our stay. She is very friendly and easy to talk with and very helpful too. Thank you for the WINE AND GIFT!!!

659,"Location - a very short 7min walk to the heart of Myeongdong. Near 2 train stations. Lots of restaurants & a nice cafe ""Luft Coffee"" around the corner. Convenience store a minute away. Personally I'd rather stay here, away from the lights & noise of Myeongdong. You could take the Airport Limousine (no.6015/6001) directly to T-mark hotel & a very short walk to G2 Hotel.It wasn't a hassle at all with our 2 big & heavy luggage bags. You could also take the public train from Incheon airport to Seoul station & transfer to either Chungmuro/Euljiro 3-ga station.G2 Hotel - Top class. The staff are incredibly polite & helpful, all of them spoke fluent English. Reception is open 24hrs. And that marble interior at the reception area, so lush & beautiful! The room itself was sparkling clean, especially the toilet. It felt like we came back to a new room everyday after house keeping. Everything looked brand new (this hotel is apparently 2 years old). They provided Innisfree toiletries which is a bonus, hair dryer, coffee & tea, kettle, mini fridge, TV, hangers.We really appreciated the heater/air conditioner in the room. It was a cold 0 degree Celsius outside but the room was nice & cozy at our selected temperature of 20. This feature is what older hotels in the heart of Myeongdong lacked, a lot of those hotels have centralized air conditioning that doesn't allow you to alter the temperature of the room. G2 hotel has a controller built into the wall, so you can increase/decrease the temperature as you please. Rooms are quiet, because you're away from the heart of Myeongdong's chaos, you'll get yourself a quiet night's sleep. Blackout curtains allowed us to sleep in a little longer too. I really have nothing but high praises for G2 hotel. I would book this hotel again in a heartbeat on our next trip back to Seoul.","April 4, 2019","12    G2 Hotel

660,"I would highly recommend this hotel for its great location, spacious rooms and most importantly, for its excellent customer service even during a last minute cancellation.My mom & I booked this hotel for 6 nights. Unfortunately, due to a family emergency, we had to fly back much earlier and could only stay 1 night. We had booked months earlier and only gave the hotel 24 hours notice about having to cancel the remaining 5 nights. We arrived around 11pm on a Sunday night and had to leave at 5.45am to catch a 9am Monday morning flight.In spite of the short notice, the hotel was extremely professional and promptly processed our cancellation in a fuss-free way. We paid for the 1 night we stayed and 1 extra nights’ charge as a cancellation fee, but otherwise the hotel waived all the charges for the remaining nights. We thought this was fair given the extremely late notice. We had bought some gifts for our Korean friends but could not pass it to them as we were leaving early. The hotel was kind enough to let us leave our gifts with the front desk for our friends to pick up.Special thanks to the manager, J Y Park, who helped us. Overall, we were really grateful for the excellent and thoughtful customer service during a stressful time.Although we only stayed 1 night, we had a really good experience during our short stay. Our room was spacious and had all the needed amenities (toiletries, coffee/tea making facilities, TV, hotel safe). It would have been a perfect base from which to explore Seoul! I think the hallmark of a good hotel is whether they provide great customer service in a difficult situation. In this regard, this hotel impressed me and has gained my trust. Definitely hope and plan to return to this hotel next time I visit Seoul. Thank you again for all your help. ","March 25, 2019","12    G2 Hotel

The location of the hotel, just a short walk from Myeongdong and two main subway stations, is ideal for exploring. We stayed in a room on the 12th floor. The rooms are simple but modern and functional. The level of cleanliness was great and the daily room clean was clearly thorough.The lobby staff were polite and helpful, even helping to send some postcards on my behalf. They were also keen on helping us organise our onward travel to Busan. My only drawback was the fact I arrived at the hotel very early, around 7am. When I enquired about the possibility of an early check-in, the receptionist said it wasn’t possible, despite the hotel looking half empty. I understand that this is subject to availability, but even when I came back at midday, I was told I had to wait until 2pm. Other than that, a great experience and would definitely recommend.","March 6, 2019","12    G2 Hotel

I suggested those 2 tennis ball-liked object should be removed as soon as possible to avoid similar accidents for other guests.I highly recommend this hotel and will definitely return for my next visit in Seoul.","August 29, 2018","12    G2 Hotel

It was a standard room so I’m sure you can get a larger room. There is a heated seat in the bathroom and that was pretty cool.Location 5/5Exactly why we picked this place, it’s in the Center of the Myeongdong shopping district.Service 3/5We got there around 12:30pm and were told come back at 2 because that’s when check-in starts. Ok that’s fine but the place is massive so I find it hard to believe they didn’t have a room ready.When our room was ready we had to carry our own bags which I’m cool with but they have signs everywhere that it’s a ‘Michelin’ hotel so I thought they’d do more.Value 4/5For the location the room is not a bad price. The food is grossly overpriced.We were able to take a free shuttle to the airport provided by the hotel (~30 mins away) so that was nice but there are only two times per day (no exceptions).Food N/AWe didn’t eat at the hotel because they only had a buffet breakfast and a 3 course dinner option.

703,"Family of 3 adults. Royal Hotel in Myeongdong is in a very lively part of the city, centrally located. They offer a welcome soft drink upon arrival. But: very quiet inside! They do offer free airport transport, but limited times. When we arrived in Seoul (evening), we'd missed the free bus, so we took public bus 6015 from Gate 5B - which dropped us off at the corner, near the hotel. It cost Won 13,500 and took 40 minutes. We bought an 'AmazingPay' card (similar to Octopus Card in Hong Kong) for Won 50,000 each (including Won 4,000 fee) at the airport. We used it everywhere and you can top up at 7-11 and other outlets. Well worth it. The hotel also runs a free bus from 11am every morning around the city with 4 drop off points. The 'family room' was a squeeze :( - with the double bed being pushed up against the wall, but it was OK with all freebies, like percolated coffee, free water, hair dryer, slippers, bathrobes, etc., and a free 1/2 bottle of a nice red wine when we arrived. The hotel bar prices are expensive, given its' location - close to other bars and clubs. They should reduce their prices to be more competitive. Also, the breakfast was OK, but didn't have a fresh noodle section, which we had expected. We only ate there once. Overall, the hotel was clean (except the bedroom carpet), staff were lovely (but not always understood our English) … but was in a great location - with Myeongdong street stalls, street food (all delicious), local shops (H&M, Zara, Nike, Adidas, Uniqlo etc) and very close to good transport links around the City. I would recommend the Royal Hotel as a very convenient location with good services.","April 29, 2019","13    Royal Hotel Seoul

704,"Got to stay 4 nights with my spouse and my tour mates. Never got to interact much with front desk since our organiser was the one facilitating giving our keys etc. Lobby was modest ,to say the least. But it was beautiful inside. I’m not saying it was luxurious but it was more like it. Our room was on the small side , a little hard to move around and even unpack your luggage. A/C was centralised . It was spring season . And it was on heat/ warm mode. So ended up opening a small part of the glass windows for a little cool breeze to settle in. But amenities was , it was good. Loved the huge flat screen LED Tv . Loved my comfortable bed. Even my bathroom. Loved the toiletries and the automated bidet. The breakfast buffet at the top most floor serves a nice selection. Liked the bulgogi and the international selection. But menu choices in the buffet doesn’t change. I hope that there are variations in the selection somehow. Wireless internet was complimentary, and relatively fast. Rarely encountered some spotty areas. There’s a gym , I’m not sure if there’s a swimming pool though . There’s a nice spa, and I sort of missed having my own treatment. But the biggest advantage of this hotel is definitely the location. Looks like it’s in the pulsating heart of Myeongdong. It’s an out of the door into everything feel. From the vaunted street food karts , cosmetic shops, designer stores, convenience 24/7 outlets , fast food places , retail, everything.

I stayed here for a week ending 9 April, but had to pay for shuttle bus 6015 because the hotel’s free shuttle bus runs only at 6:30 pm and this time did not suit me.My room (no. 1318) was very comfortable and had everything I needed, including a comfortable bed, very good free wifi and TV with some English language channels (BBC and CNN only).I had breakfast here on the first day only (I wrongly thought it was included) and had to pay 25,000 Won, which I consider too expensive as I had only cereal with milk and yoghurt, grapefruit juice and coffee. Not many travellers want to fill up on bacon and eggs, omelette made to order, cheese and sausage etc; it’s healthier to have a light breakfast, but they will still charge you 25,000 Won.Myeongdong is a very nice area with a great ambience and lots of restaurants.The Royal Hotel is quite expensive unless you can get a better rate, and on my next trip to Seoul I plan to stay at the nearby Metro Hotel.If you come here by shuttle bus 6015 it’s best to get off at the Ibis Hotel opposite the Lotte Department Store. If you get off the next stop, which is closer to the Royal, you will have a steep walk with some broken pavement to negotiate with your luggage.","April 13, 2019","13    Royal Hotel Seoul

I straight away booked a room for 3 nights.After I booked the room I sent message to the hotel saying that I would be arrived at Seoul Station and departed from Incheon and I would need the Free Shuttle Bus and asked them to confirm. I did this on 30Nov18. Didn't get any response from the hotel until the day I arrived in Seoul 30Dec18.I was wondered around the train station try to find The Royal Hotel Seoul Free Shuttle Bus pick up point but could not find it. I called the hotel. Then being told that the Free Shuttle Bus from/to station is no longer available. Very very disappointing. More over becasue the hotel staff who answered the phone didn't even say sorry. Is this a language limitation?Still - they should have response the message I sent.I finally got a taxi from station to Royal Hotel Seoul.Check in was straight forward. After check in done I mentioned again about my disappointment regarding the Free Shuttle Bus and the check in Staff just went silent. Is this nother language imitation?Royal Hotel Seoul looks very WOW. It tries to keep the statement of its name on Michelin Guide I suppose but is the overall review of the hotel worth the list?The room is a bit tired - it can do with some refreshment touch. Especially the bathroom - a shower with a dirty look curtain doesn't go parallel with the pretentious lobby. I'm sorry. Wooden selves in bathroom is just so decades ago interior.Another thing I found out was the robe - it has the sewing torn out. Another thing that doesn't go parallel with the WOW lobby. I took photo of this as a proof if the hotel contacted me ^_^ Also the hotel could invest with some new robe as the two provided in my room was both 'hard' - washed out, worn out.Shampoo, conditioner, shower gel - Good Lord - amenities in a small tube/bottle is also another decades invention. And also squeezing tube is not very Royal, isn't it? Nowadays a lot of hotels provide amentities in a big bottle which I believe for good reason - reducing packaging waste! More environmental friendly!And I personally would suggest Royal Hotel Seoul to provide amenities which is Made in Korea. Be proud of your own products - Korean amenities well known for good quality. Support the nation business/economy. Why is it needs to be amenities from UK?","January 19, 2019","13    Royal Hotel Seoul

713,"We were sent here on a Air Asiana stopover flight, and whilst they said it was five star, and it wasn’t, it was still very good. If you are flying through it’s worth bearing in mind that it is right in the middle of Seoul. That means in reality that it’s about an hour door to door from the airport, which if you are with two kids and a load of luggage is a hassle to get to and from BUT the upside is that, with only four hours or so to spare we got up and out early and saw one of the palaces and a couple of other tourists spots and though I don’t think it would be fair to say we ‘did’ Seoul, we got a flavour for it before heading home and that was a nice bonus.The hotel itself is nice without being over the top, it has a gentle Korean vibe, wooden fretwork behind the TVs, some quite cool lantern lighting and of course the absurdly multi-function toilets that are ubiquitous, our rooms were not huge, but we were there for one night and the were FINE.Important to note: the breakfast here is GREAT. It’s at the top of the building and includes a mix of western and Asian food, and I have nothing negative to say about it. If you have stayed at the Four Seasons or Anantara you’ll know what five star is, and this isn’t that, but it’s still pretty impressive.","January 18, 2019","13    Royal Hotel Seoul

721,- The shuttle bus from Incheon airport took over an hour but it was well worth it cause as a one night stop over visitor to Seoul it allowed my family and I too gain a glimpse of what Seoul had too offerand we were well impressed with what we saw!!-An amazing hotel situated in the heart of a busy shopping area which was a bonus for me as I am one who likes to shop. -The customer service and facilities provided at the hotel is amazing which ticked all the boxes for me !!- very clean- the presentation of the breakfast bar I would give it a 10/10 . - I wanna thank the evening and morning staff that were on duty on the 29/10-30/10 for a wonderful job of been helpful to my family and I during our one night stay !!- I would definitely recommend this hotel to others .- I would definitely book this hotel again when I next visit Seoul !!,"November 5, 2018","13    Royal Hotel Seoul

722,"""Fantastic hotel, no cooling in rooms ""I loved everything about this hotel except it didn’t have cooling in the room! The hotel is lovely in an absolutely fantastic location near markets, restaurants, shopping centre, tourist attractions everything you need. The club level lounge was very nice with snacks and drinks throughout the day and nice beer, wine, spirits and bubbles for happy hour in the evening. Breakfast in level 21 restaurant was plentiful and loads of variety. Very professional staff from the time we arrived till we left. The room on floor 19 was small but had everything you need, a very modern bathroom with ‘flash toilet’ and all amenities supplied. We found the room too warm and couldn’t turn the aircon down, spoke to executive lounge concierge who advised only heating was available in rooms. They quickly organised a fan for us but this wasn’t overly effective. We made do, if it was warmer weather we would have looked at moving hotels. I’m so disappointed because this hotel was 98% perfect for us but we wouldn’t rebook and I can’t recommend to friends or family- unless we/they visit in winter.","November 1, 2018","13    Royal Hotel Seoul

723,"We have stayed in a junior suite on executive level. It is slightly more expensive, but you get a very comfortable room, with great views. The room is on a smaller sideby the US standards, but acceptable. You also get access to the lounge on the top floor,with even better views, free breakfast, and food and drinks throughout the day. You do not need to spend money on food. The location is great: you are within walking distanceto lots of interesting places. They even have a shuttle to the Incheon airport and the main train station (not frequently, though). We have enjoyed our stay a lot.","October 29, 2018","13    Royal Hotel Seoul

Breakfast served in the restaurant offered a very good choice. My only quibble was that the staff were focussed on telling us that breakfast finished at 10 rather than welcoming us.

It was a rainy day when we stayed and the hotel had free umbrellas for the guests which I thought was really nice. Even though the rooms are a bit small, we had a perfectly comfortable stay as everything we needed is in the room. The hotel is located very near the shops and restaurants, a convenience store and Starbucks is right across the street as well.

727,Hotel is located just a few steps from Myeongdong night market and lots of shops. Breakfast buffet is good with a beautiful view of the surrounding area from the 21st floor.

728,"I also got stuck there due to a delay on Asiana Airlines, which is another story.This hotel was surprisingly nice, and the breakfast buffet is excellent, esp. for the small scale of the restaurant area. It has a nice view of the Myung-dong and the Catholic cathedral on one side. I hadn't been to Korea for over 15 years, but the view of the neighborhood, and the location in the heart of Myung-dong, which is a fun metro area, was quite enjoyable.The only problem I'd like to mention is the hand-off and communication between Asiana and the hotel. When the staff at Asiana and the hotel refer to it as a ""limo bus"" to the airport, it's confusing. Some staff told me to come to the lobby and wait there to be called for the ""limo bus"", but then when I asked in the morning, they said to basically walk to the other side of the block to basically catch the city bus to the airport, which is what we ended up doing. No problem finding and taking the bus, but both Asiana and the Royal staff should just call it what it is -- a ""city bus"", to avoid confusion, esp. for travelers who are already off schedule due to an airline problem.","September 14, 2018","13    Royal Hotel Seoul

729,"The room is tiny, possibly the smallest executive room I have ever stayed in! Location is great, opposite the hotel is great restaurants, just below the hotel is the shopping streets, street food and behind the hotel the grocery stores, ginseng shops plus so much more. But the room and its layout is just so small that for 3 adults would be so cramped that I truly cannot accept. Rather inflexible that the suite room which is bigger is not allowed to add in a bed. I was on a trip with the company so I just bear with it since I did not want to be a nuisance to the rest of the people I was travelling with. Otherwise, I will exchange a hotel due to the size of the room. Btw there is no connecting room. I tend to agree with the reviewer that there is no bell hop for the luggage when we checked in and little assistance during our stay, except for the concierge. The state of the hotel is good, but absolutely not for smokers who wish to have a sit down place to chill.","September 8, 2018","13    Royal Hotel Seoul

733,"The hotel acted high and mighty. I and my friends took the shuttle bus to Gimpo Airport. But the bus took us to Incheon. You know… they confirmed the reservation when you booked、boarded. The bus driver shouted us and let us went Gimpo by ourselves. The worst is that the manager told us the hotel had thing wrong ,they will pay the fare to Gimpo. When we back our country , the manager told us that we booked a shuttle bus to Incheon , it’s our fault. they didn't apologize . Anyway, the hotel is irresponsible.

734,"Went there last week and stayed 4 nights. I booked premier triple room. Supposed to get a nicer room. At the same time, my friend is staying at the same hotel in a lower floor.First night, the AC vent on the ceiling was dripping water. After a long day, i had to call the front desk to address the dripping water issue. A guy came to took a quick look and said, it is an AC! my husband asked if this is supposed to happen with your AC? he said yes. And he said he will sent a technician to my room anyway. Tech came to confirm, it is fine, suck it up. will stop in an hour. After an hour, 1am, i hear some indoor raining, got my suitcase wet. Called again, they moved me to a suckier room at lower floor. On the 2 second morning, my husband went to try congee for breakfast. I took my daughter to join my friends for hotel breakfast buffet. My friends room came with breakfast. Food was ok, but selection is limited. The bill came, they charged my friends full amount. Even tho they already took their room number and confirmed they are covered. Have to tell them again and they removed it. My 6 yrs old paid USD18 to eat 2 pieces of watermelon, and she wanted to leave. I called my hubby to get her. As my hubby entered the restaurant, the lady told him that buffet was closing in 10 mins, so cannot serve him. He said, i am just saying hi to friends. She said ok. He came to my table, the manager guy, rush to my table and said, you have 2 adult and 1 kid. i said no, he came to pay and leaving now. Manager said ok! My gave my hubby my daughter and my bill, told him to pay. The lady who told him cannot serve him, added extra adult cost. He said i just came in, and I told you i am here to get my girl and say hi. She didn't care. Manager came, my hubby goes off on him. And he finally agreed to take off the charge.Great lodging doesn't make the trip any different. A bad hospitality at the hotel, however, ruined the whole trip. So thanks Royal Hotel Seoul!","July 26, 2018","13    Royal Hotel Seoul

735,"This is a very nice hotel just at the edge of Myeongdong Shopping Streets. As a matter of fact, the placement is just where the street-food market stalls starts in the evening! Starbucks, 7-eleven as well as global ATM are all just across the street and lots and lots and lots of resturants are in the immediate area. Easy access to both busses and subway as well as walking distance to a lot of places :). The hotel itself is very nice and clean. Hotel room felt fresh and spacious, even though our previous hotel room in Gangnam was bigger, this felt more spacious. We did have a few complaints though.. as we had booked 3 adults and 1 child of 16 in a 3+1 room, we asked for an extra down comforter, but was only given a very uncomfortable blanket. This room was marked bookable for 4 people.. so it would have been nice if it had had the ""gear"" for it too.Another thing was the cleaning of the room, my son felt sick a few days and stayed at the hotel trying to sleep, and was almost in a fight with the cleaning-lady. In the end, she didn't bother do room-cleaning the last day and I had to call reception when we came back from the shopping tour to ask them for new towels and to take out trash as we were packing to leave the next morning and were ""minimizing"" what we brought with us, a.k.a. unwrapping and unpacking some boxes. I would not recomend breakfast at this hotel. I would strongly suggest anyone to go out and have something on the street instead! We tried breakfast once, and it was bland and pretty boring! I don't know if it is better in the executive area as we didn't have that kind of room. The bad breakfast kept us from booking a dinner at the hotel as it was the same resturant.. All in all, this IS a very good hotel in the best location I can imagine! I will absolutely return to this Hotel next time I am going to Korea :). ","July 11, 2018","13    Royal Hotel Seoul

736,"Stayed at the Royal Hotel Seoul in mid December and January which was very cold. The airport shuttle arrived on time to pick us up and drove all the way in front of the hotel. The check in was very smooth and timely. This hotel is literally the centre of Myeongdong, was very easy to shop for hours and let us run back due to -20 degree temperature.. Although the train station is 7mins away, taxi cabs on right in front of the hotel while they have frequent shuttles that go to Seoul Station. This was a good service as it made it easier to plan our trip to Busan. This would definitely be the hotel to choose when staying in Seoul, I am extremely happy to be coming in next week to this hotel again! ","July 8, 2018","13    Royal Hotel Seoul

737,"convenient location to lotte deparment store and the korean small local rice noodle shop which queue up from 11am to 7 pm and not understand the reason for the queuing but if hungry at 2am, it is 20 steps from the hotel door. Royal hotel is a standard japanese style hotel but not like okura or nikko which greet you in a japanese majestic way at all times to everyone, here regular customers might find them having a better welcome than ocassional room room rental customers. Royal hotel seoul is the one hotel that is very exceptional, the hotel is genuine, very good with their standards, they will never give you anything extra, as a hotel guest you will not have discount to the restaurant and if you want late check out,you need to pay hk $70 for an extra hour even on a Monday. This is really a fair deal and this hotel is strict and not count on any customerrequest, need or expectation - no extra and only money. The toilet uses marble, it is grant! The royal hotel is a patriotic to China, using china made tooth brush, shampoo, shower gel despite most korean hotels are using korean made shampoo and bath soap, this is something I like and the quality is good, definitely will come back to stay for these pro-china products and speculatively, may be the hotel restaurant is using ingredients from china instead of korean which I have not idea. Even the curtain is the ? china made $10 one, if not wrong, i can recognise the buckle on the rail. It is clean. The bed has only one pillow, for a person. The bed quality is good. I, just happened to look down at the floor underneath the bed, when I was searching my headphone, it was dusty, dirty and there was a piece of candy there. As a whole, a very enjoyable stay.

742,"It was my first trip to Seoul. I did research all the hotels’ reviews in TA here to find the best hotel to meet my preferences.Why did i choose RHS?Was it its location? It’s right inside Myeongdong, so enough said already. But so are the Lotte and Skypark chain of hotels. But it’s worth to mention that RHS is situated between 2 subway lines within 5 mins of brisk walking.Or because it’s conveniently accessible from the Incheon and Gimpo Airports? Most who stay in Myeongdong would surely use the airport limousine bus which made stops within yards of most hotels. Though RHS offers free airport shuttle, any day there’s only 2 service running and your arrival may not fit into its schedule. But then there’s another option. Ride the AREX to Seoul Station. Take the lift to 3F to exit the turnstile and immediately on your right take the lift to 1F. Out of the lift on your right you will see one of the station exits. Here you can take the RHS free shuttle right to the hotel doorstep. But i also knew that Tmark and Skypark hotels operate free shuttle there too. [Here i deviate so as to mention the Seoul Station Airport Terminal. If you are flying out of Incheon on a SK airline flight, and use the AREX Express, you should take advantage to do the flight check-in at the station. You bypass the crowd and long lines at the airport checking-in, and also enter airside through a dedicated express immigration/customs clearance. Save you much hassle and extra time to explore the beautiful airport.]I decided on RHS because they offered a affordable package stay for members. Free instant sign-up at their website. Included were a deluxe room, daily buffet breakfast for 2, in-room premium coffee, daily 1-piece laundry, 1-time welcome drink and daily cake & beverage (choose from menu) in the coffeehouse, a welcome gift and Club access.Why did i give a 3* rating for my stay? The property itself deserves fully 5*, but i rate my stay experience 2*.Really there’s nothing to fault the property. My partner loved the entrance revolving door which so far we had only seen in 5-star hotels. It’s relatively new, so condition is spick and span. The ambience throughout is quite nice and one could get a good feel like being in a 5-star property. The Club on the 21F has a stately atmosphere and great view of the iconic Seoul N Tower. The room size by Seoul standard is quite good. The king-size bed is firm and very comfortable. The website says they have a pillow menu but I didnt have the need for it. WiFi connectivity is good and fast. The big LCD TV offered a wide selection of channels. All the amenities one would expect at a 4-star hotel are there. The bathroom was equipped with full set of bath amenities which were replenished daily. The shower and taps water temperature & pressure was consistently good. The buffet breakfast in the restaurant had a very good spread and live egg station. At the Club continental breakfast was served and as normal choices are limited. We did have the option to dine at either place. I would say that the property exceeds its 4-star rating. Perhaps 5-star but without a swimming pool.Why made me not too thrilled with the stay?I arrived Incheon early morning after the airport shuttle scheduled time. So proceed to Seoul Station on AREX to catch the station shuttle bus. (Personally it was more convenient for me as I wanted to limit my walk dragging 2 large suitcases.) I almost missed the shuttle. The minibus with the RHS livery was in the parking lot all the while before the scheduled departure time. The driver drove up to the assigned waiting spot, took a glance at us (there were only 2 of us) and before i could react he drove off. I chased after him and luckily he did stop for us. He came out and I told him we were going to RHS. He then demanded proof that we were RHS guests. I would not say that he was rude but his manners were curt.We could not do the check-in but were allowed to leave our suitcases at the Concierge. It was 10:30am. The 3-staff Concierge was especially busy with guests streaming into the lobby to deposit their bags, but the 4-staff Front Desk was relatively unoccupied having only to handle occasionally guests checking out. Made me wonder why they couldn’t just do the check-in process and then we returned later to pick up the room key. (This was my experience with hotels in Bangkok, HongKong and China cities.) It was cold outside so i hanged around in the lobby for awhile using the WiFi to organise my emails. And as I observed the happenings in the lobby, I noticed the staff attitude towards different guests rather inconsistent. So much so that i thought they were actually selective, if you catch my drift. I did not have a good vibe being there so I spent the next 3 hours at the Starbucks opposite the hotel.At check-in time, joined a line and when my turn came, was told to bring my bags with me to do the check-in at the Club on the 21F. Here the management ought to take note for improvement which is my objective for writing this review. An prior email to prompt me of this privilege would have save me some hassle. And if had allowed the early check-in (just the registration) and let me rest in the Club it would be excellent. And also save me the hassle trudging with my suitcases up to the 21F and then to my room. Could not arrange for my bags sent from Concierge to my room after check-in? And on the subject of email, I sent an email to reservations to seek clarification of the airport shuttle schedule which was ignored. Subsequently i posted the enquiry in the website then the reply came.On one occasion i was waiting for the lift with 2 staff in suits who appeared obviously to be RHS managers. We exchanged glances, yet they just displayed a nonchalant attitude. Not a greeting or just a smile for a guest your hotel?Throughout my short 3-night stay i felt an air of snobbery among the staff. The only greetings i got are from the humble housekeeping staff i met at the rooms corridor and the servers at breakfast. But there were 2 saving grace. One was a young female Concierge staff whom i approached to asked about the free shuttle to Seoul N Tower. Knowing that the bus was already scheduled to depart she personally ushered us out to catch the bus. When i realised that we were the only 2 passengers i didn’t want to be bothersome and suggested making the 20-minute walk there instead. But she was so persistent that I use the shuttle, repeatedly assuring me that it was the hotel service which I was entitled to use. The other was the male service staff at the coffeehouse where we had our daily cake & beverage. Seem like he was the only staff then (before noon, April 16-18). Very friendly gentleman who could remember our preferred beverages after the first day order. Regretfully I did not get either of their names because my poor eyesight couldnt read their name tags. The concierge girl spoke good English.And by the way, another good reason I choose this hotel over the nearby Lotte - I smoke, and this hotel has room that allow smoking.","May 31, 2018","13    Royal Hotel Seoul

743,I really enjoyed my stay here. The location is right at the start of the street shopping craziness of Myeongdong. So easy to bring your bags of shopping back to your room to go out for more. The hotel was built with 5 star aspirations but the location and current pricing is bringing tacky tourist like me feeling a bit underdressed when I walk in the lobby. We had the standard king room which was small but very clean and nicely appointed. Nice bar set up with wine glasses and free coffee and tea. The wash let toilet was wonderful. The housekeeper on the 12th floor was amazing. So friendly and helpful. I wish I got her name. Late check out at 2:00 pm cost me an extra $22 but was worth it. Free shuttle to the airport. Highly recommend for the price we paid. Side note: we arrived at the airport just before midnight and most of the trains and busses were stopped. We took the international taxi for $65 door to door. Great service from our driver Mr. Jin. ,"May 25, 2018","13    Royal Hotel Seoul

744,"From the Incheon airport, take shuttle bus 6015 (cost KRW $15,000) and it will take you to the main street (Eulji-ro), once off the bus, just walk east (continue with the direction where the bus travels) to the first small street, turn right to walk up hill and turn right again at the end of the road and the hotel is at your right hand side. The hotel is very similar to hotels in Japan. Small room, but clean and comfortable. There is also an umbrella in the closet for rainy days. The toilet has bidet and automatically flushes. With jet-lag, I was looking for the flush button and pressed the ""Emergency"" button by mistake. 15 seconds later, the front desk called to make sure that everything was ok :)I got a Myeondong map from the front desk and it has pretty much all the key points of the area. Day 1: I walked east from the hotel to Kwangjang market (~30 min) and Dongdaemun though the alley with many restaurants selling the special chicken soup. I ate at the one with less people waiting and it was not too bad, though cost KRW $22,000! There is a restaurant next to it selling dog meat soup :(I did not visit Jongmyo shrine, but you should add it since it is in the same area.Day 2: I walked north through Insa dong to Bukchon village (~ 40 min.), to Gwanghwamun and then back. I also recommend visiting Myeongdong Cathedral, which is just southeast of the hotel two minutes walking distance.There are two restaurants that I highly recommended, once is the Sinseon Seolleongtang (milky bone soup), which is across the street from the hotel to the right. Another one is Myeongdong Kyoja, which is famous for their dumplings and noodles.","May 21, 2018","13    Royal Hotel Seoul

Robes and slippers are provided and makes you feel right at home. Bed is very comfy. Two free bottled waters everyday. We included the breakfast when we booked.

747,"This Hotel is conveniently located in Myeong-dong area. The only plus. But we encountered a lot of issues/problem during the stay. 1. Upon arrival we checked in at the front desk and a guy who doesn’t have any name plate assisted me. I have several questions and he said “stop talking” with a hand gesture.2. The a/c inside our room wasn’t working retaining the 26 degrees temperature which wasn’t really comfortable. I tried telling them 3 times but wasn’t fixed during pur 4 night stay. 3. The lounge access wasn’t really worth it paying extra. 4. They made a mistake regarding my bill. We stayed at the lobby for an hour to wait for the bus shuttle but did not realize the error they made. Upon arrival at the airport we weren’t allowed to go down the bus and an “employee” ( claimed he is) in civilian clothes, without any if id with him told me to pay them the balance i “owe” them. A girl who wasn’t even apologetic over the phone which the guy handed me. demanded me to pay them the money i owed them. I told them it’s your mistake and now you are harassing me? This is something that can be handled properly if they can communicate in a nice way. But the way they approach me and told me about the error wasn’t really right and even told me i cannot ever leave the country.

749,"We decided to stay at this Hotel, instead of Marriott Courtyard Namdaemun (where we stayed last), to be in the middle of Myeongdong. We were so happy with the decision.The Hotel is great - great location and great price. We booked a Family Room with discounted rate for being the Hotel preferred guest. When we checked in late (after 11PM), the Room was already prepared for us on the high floor with a bottle of wine. We were also given cakes and drinks as welcome gifts, which we picked up 2 days later.The Family Room was spacious, with 3 beds. It was perfect for the 3 of us - one bed for each. It was clean. Bottled water was put in the room daily. I am not sure whether because I am a Hotel preferred guest or not. But the additional care is nice.The location is perfect, as we could walk to any restaurants and shops, and the street vendors. They are literally just outside the hotel door. Lotte Department Store is just a few minutes away. My wife and daughter enjoyed their shopping as they just walked back to drop stuff and continued their shopping. Other shopping (Namdaemun Market) and attractions are nearby. We were able to walk from Gyeongbokgung Palace back to the Hotel.The only disappointment is the light daily schedule for the complimentary shuttle to/from airport, as we were not able to take advantage of it. I wish the Hotel would add more trips to the schedule.This hotel is DEFINITE our Seoul hotel from now on.","April 27, 2018","13    Royal Hotel Seoul

761,"Location was everything with this hotel and for the most part, staff was friendly, especially the guys calling for cabs or greeting you at the door. There were two gentlemen that I wish I knew their names because they were super friendly and always greeting me every time I came into the hotel. That was a good feeling. The room was nice and comfortable. I think my only gripe is similar to the others who mentioned about early check in. I think perhaps the hotel should review its policy on early check-ins. In our case we were super early to the hotel as we flew in from Los Angeles. It's kind of beyond our control that our plane arrives in the early morning. I was willing to pay extra for early check-in but they said no. As a result we had to wait from around 8am to 2pm. That's a long wait especially when you've already had a such a long night/day of travel. As the final hours approached during our wait it became almost comical as we noticed the staff were running out of space to hold the luggage of other travelers waiting to get their rooms. The staff then had to place suitcases in the lobby area and then they put some sort of large fishnet over the suitcases to designate the area I guess. It was quite a sight. Overall, I actually would stay here again as I really loved the location and being so close to the street food and easy access to transportation is always great. Seoul is quite a city and if you really want to make your stomach happy, go to the incredible Gwangjang Market. Wow! The food there is so amazing and the overall atmosphere is really nice..","February 18, 2018","13    Royal Hotel Seoul

We arrived fairly late in the evening but staff were very friendly and efficient. They quickly checked us in, gave us meal vouchers and informed us of the restaurant location, meal times and pick-up times.This was good as we were all very tired and did not want to be hanging around for long.Complimentary dinner consisted of a meat or vegetarian option. Each option was accompanied by soup and bread roll for a starter. Dinner was lovely.Rooms are very clean and warm. They also provide you with shower gel, lotion, shampoo etc, as well as other amenities such as a shaver and ear buds. This I found to be perfect as often you forget to pack these things in carry on luggage.The beds were comfortable to sleep in and curtains did a good job at keeping the lights out.Breakfast in the morning was more than enough and we all were able to make sure we had a good meal before heading back to the airport for our next flight.The hotel is also right in the city and if you have enough energy, walk into the city after dinner. There is a lot of activity, street food and a lot of shops will be open!

Korea is technically advanced but the simple touches at this hotel made it stand out from the rest.We got the usual you’d expect from a good quality hotel such as tea and coffee, complimentary water, shampoo and shower gel. There were also robes and slippers to make you feel extra comfortable. It seemed they’d thought of everything as in the bathroom drawer there was a hairdryer, toothbrush, toothpaste, shower cap and a sewing kit. The toilet had a lovely washing system which including bided, seat warmer and bottom dryer!My favourite and most useful extra touch was the electrical sockets which had usb, European, British, Australia and US. Why can’t every hotel provide this simple item? It made life much easier than rummaging for adaptor plugs.The staff were courteous and friendly, we didn’t eat dinner as we’d eaten in the flight but had a nightcap at the bar. They didn’t seem eager for us to go to bed and brought us a second sink when they saw that we’d finished our first.Breakfast was great. Again the staff were courteous and the food was lovely. On departure the concierge and reception manager came into the bus to wish us well and thank us for staying with them. They then waved us off until out of sight!A very pleasant stay in an interesting, bit very cold Seoul. If you ever visit at this time of year, take plenty of warm clothing as it’s freezing!

770,"Clean, newish, and reasonably priced Myeong Dong hotel with some stylish touches. A good, if not great choice for the following reasons:Posities:-stylish executive floor lounge with sweeping views of central Seoul.-Central and convenient location, within walking distance of many sites.-free shuttle bus service to airport and elsewhere, but running during only limited hours.Negatives:-charges for ice delivery: $3. (pick up your ice at the 7-11 across the street).-some staff did not speak good English or were not particularly accommodating.-Limited food and drink choices in executive lounge, but still well worth the extra expense.-smallish rooms but not crampt.Overall, this hotel offers good value for the money. The location and executive lounge experience set the hotel apart from others in this upper-middle class range.

I gave an average rating as it's a great location but how it got a michelin award for 2017 beats me as the rooms are a little dim. I should have stayed Hotel 28 again as it's just on the other side, brightly lit and their staff .. thumbs up. Royal hotel however, has a mix of helpful and rude ones particularly the shuttle bus driver whom i have even attached his picture for rude behavior. At Seoul station boarding area, 13:50, 2 of us asked if the bus will leave at 14:10 since it's our first time taking the shuttle. He asked to see the hotel room card so we went up to the entrance to get it from our friends. Took just a minute since friends were just waiting behind the door entrance but the driver drove off to the parking lot?! We walked out to where he parked ..he was on the phone so we waited for quite some time and decided to show him our card from the window but he ignored us so we walked to the bus door but he shut the door immediately. Fine... got back to the entrance to wait, we saw him walk pass us twice to get his coffee and smoke, he saw us too but ignored us until it was 14:10, he drove to the boarding area and said we can board. When there's a little traffic jam, he was impatient and made some noise cursing some other driver. What is wrong with this guy.. First and last time to take this shuttle.. on another occasion, I wanted to borrow a lighter for a birthday cake but the female receptionist told me to buy it as she does not have one. Okay sure i can do that but she could ask the staff beside her or the staff room ..come on, most koreans smoke. I mean, she should be telling me that rooms have smoke detectors and it is a risk to lend guests lighters, hotel policy etc etc..

773,"I’m writing this review at 7:30 a.m. local time inside the hotel room. I’d prefer to be sleeping at this time of the day since this is meant to be a vacation. This is my second night here. On the first night, I must have woke up at least five times in the night. The heater in the room is somehow set at 27C and there’s nothing I could do to change it. So when it’s 2C outside I was sweating all night trying to get some sleep. Worse still the auto sensor doorway light which is meant to switch on when someone enters the room just randomly decides to go on and off at midnight, which is terribly annoying if not freaky. Second night, I figured that I should open the only window inside the room for some fresh air and to beat the heat. Unfortunately it was Christmas Eve and the rap music from the street is clearly audible even on this 19th floor. I ended up pulling the room card out from the electricity supply slot to stop the air con from functioning and rushing hot air out but this means no light whatsoever for midnight bio breaks. I booked last minute so had paid US$400 for a hot and tiny room with a double bed and not much space left. Breakfast choice is very limited also. It’s the location you are paying for and not much more. I booked this hotel based on TA reviews but hopefully others will know what to expect before booking.

774,"For me the location of a hotel is always of prime consideration, along with price and quality. The Royal Hotel Seoul met my expectation across the board. The Royal is situated in the heart of the Myeongdong, an upscale shopping area of Seoul with a wide selection of restaurants within easy walking distance. It was also close to the departure point for the Seoul City Bus Tour and to the departure point for my visit to the DMZ. My room, albeit smaller than one might find in the USA, was comfortable, well appointed, and very clean. In all fairness smaller hotel rooms are pretty much the norm in Seoul so the overall hotel experience does not rate a penalty in this regard. I took a bus from the airport to the hotel. The bus does not stop directly at the hotel, rather nearby, which required a relatively short (several hundred yards) but uphill walk to reach the hotel. If you are traveling with a large amount of luggage or are disable to some extent than another mode of transport might be more suitable. The bus driver was not very helpful in pointing me in the right direction to find the hotel but a private security guard at an office building next to the bus stop set me off on the correct course. Overall I would most certainly opt to stay at the Royal Hotel during my next visit to Seoul, and would definitely recommend it to others.","December 15, 2017","13    Royal Hotel Seoul

Just few mins away to different subways stations and department stores. I booked a corner suite at reasonable rate. We even are given access to the club lounge at top floor which can oversee the beautiful view of Seoul and where you can enjoy some light snacks, fruits and drinks. The quality of breakfast is very good too with sufficient choices of food. I highly recommend you book the suites if you stay more than 3 days. Also, the hotel has free shuttle from or to airports which is very convenient and efficient. Last but not the least, I want to thank for a waiter in the lounge who helped providing a pack of ice cubes every morning for my husband to relief his shoulder's injury during the trip. The staff are very helpful although their English can be improved a bit. Overall, I highly recommend to stay in this hotel in Seoul.

The Manager left us 2 small bottles of Australian red wine as a welcoming gift, a very nice gesture. There's no swimming pool but the gym was newish. The best part was the location, you stepped right in the core of Myeongdong, you could go to all the food stalls, cosmetic shops and restaurants in your pj’s! The cathedral and 7/11 were right across the street, the Metro was a few blocks away. With all these conveniences, the hotel stood on a small slope so the noise was cut out considerably.

797,"To me when I go to Seoul not the area I`m staying in but which hotel with the best transportation access is the most important thing to consider because you spend pretty much all day riding metro or bus to see everything and it can get tiring. This hotel was perfect. When you come from Incheon or Gimpo you can take all stop KTX and get off at Gongdeok station that`s it. Station is bigger than I thought but just go to Exit 2 and look for Lotte premium market. If you`re not used to public transportation it might be confusing at first becuase there`re many people and many exits but just remember to go to Exit 2 and from there you can`t get lost because if you look up this hotel is right in front of Exit. When you arrive at night everything is so dark because supermarket and restaurants are closed so you may think this is not the right entrance but it is. Just walk through dark alley and you`ll see their elevator. There are several metro lines from this station and Seoul station is next stop so it is very convenient if you`re using KTX (bullet train). Honestly small supermarket downstairs was not what I was looking for. They call it lotte premium and more like small whole food or bristol farm in the U.S so everything was overpriced and many imported items which I was not interested in after coming to seoul. I do recommend to walk to Emart very close to this hotel if you like to buy lots of stuff and Lotte supermarket at soul station. It is huge and exciting because there are so much stuff to see and buy. Hotel breakfast was excellent and I loved their udon noodle and caramelized almond mix. Don`t worry they have plenty of choices for everybody. It can get very busy so go earlier or later. Hotel is so quiet and peaceful the only time I saw people was when I was eating breakfast and pool area. Their pool and gym were very nice but I wish they can seperate their lanes for people who want to actually exercise and for kids who just want to have fun. Make sure to bring swiming caps otherwise you can`t use their pool. I highly recommend this hotel to everybody. Convenience to public transportation fast access to both airports, clean and modern room and nice breakfast, pool and gym you can`t beat it with this price.","August 6, 2018","14    Lotte City Hotel Mapo

Airport bus stops outside, so does the train but walk underground to/from the train is long.Loved being on the 4th floor close to the pool and lifts.To roll out of bed in the morning and go for a swim before breakfast couldn’t have been easier.Long pool 20 m? With lots of day light streaming in and charmingly lit in the evening for a relaxing swim.Open 6 am until late. Mostly quiet at the pool over the weekend.Also gym facilities next to the pool . Running machine, cross trainer and some weights etc. Did not eat breakfast at the hotel.In the basement of the building there are cafes selling excellent coffee. Fabulous supermarket with stunning fresh food for sale.Our room was a bit small with twin beds.( requested) One of our party had a lovely bright large double room. Street noise did not disturb us, AC worked well.None of the sights are on the doorstep but public transport it fast, frequent, inexpensive and easy to use.Interesting choice of places to eat around the hotel with : modern, traditional, market , food available.Hotel gave a good recommendation of traditional food restaurant which was tasty, varied and Korean.

801,"The location of the hotel is very convenient - if you take the airport bus it is the second stop on the route, and going to airport it is the second to last pick up...so you don't have to spend lots of time on the bus. The station also connects 3 major metro lines, one of which is the airport line. The metro connects almost directly to the mall beneath the hotel, so if it is cold and rainy, you can get back inside without bringing out an umbrella (you step outside for a minute but there is cover). Nearby is Gongdeok market and emart, along with small shops and restaurants scattered. The hotel itself is a little bit older and the temperature adjuster seems to be for looks only (probably central controlled because the heat is not warm and the ac is not cold). Do not be tricked by the pictures as this hotel is 8 floors high only - the building behind is not part of the hotel! I was disappointed in my 5th floor room at first, only to realise there weren't that many more floors to choose from! It was pretty noisy with the traffic pretty much all day, every day...weekends included.Compared to Shilla Stay Hotel down the block, I would say this is more conveniently located, but not as new and comfortable.","May 14, 2018","14    Lotte City Hotel Mapo

Very convenient.One point for improvement will be the hotel does have a sterile feel to it, it feels devoid of furniture to fill up the area that the hotel is still in the midst of opening. This is attributed to the lack of indoor plants and the lobby feels really.. quiet. Some background music playing will create a more relaxing feel upon checking in. Staff members all speak English and very polite and willing to engage with guests. Hotel room was splendid, good strong shower pressure and room was very clean. Bed was comfy and the room offers good views of the skyscrapers in front of us. Complimentary hotel wi-fi was very fast.Didnt get to try the indoor swimming pool and the gym, they also have a sauna and a coin operated laundry.

807,"Spent two nights in the hotel. The room was modern, quiet, relatively new and spacious with a large bathroom. Everything we needed for the stay.Although not internally connected, it sits on top the Gongdeok train station which caters for 4 different metro lines and you can get to the hotel from B1 via the lifts adjacent to the Lotte market. The lobby is on L2 and no porter service, which means that if you arrive by car and get off on L1 you need to lug your luggage up via an escalator or elevator. While we stayed there was only a security guard (in a suite) posted on L1.Check-in / check-out service at the front desk was fast and efficient even with trainees taking notes.The reason I'm not giving this hotel 5 stars as it should have been easy for such a nice and clean property, is because of two things - extremely slow and frustrating lifts and no one on L1 to assist. There are businesses on the lower levels which share the lifts and found that that most of the people using the lifts were actually going to these businesses throughout the day. There is one lift dedicated to going to the hotel levels down to L1, but doesn't go down to B1, which means you either have to walk out or take another lift down. The other lifts stop at all levels which mean that at times it can take 5-10 minutes to get a lift.There is no one on L1 other than one security person (I'm assuming he's security as he had an in-ear) and when we asked him to get us a taxi, he replied by saying there's a taxi rank out front and that he can't leave his station. Because of this, I had to go down driveway, out to the curb with our luggage and secure a taxi myself. The hotel really needs to rethink what customers expect/want and the services they need to provide as this is something I've taken for granted at any established hotel anywhere in the world. I was surprised because I though it was a inconsistent with the Lotte brand name and being rated a 5 star hotel. Getting to both airports is easy via trains, but beware that if you have bulky luggage it's not easy finding lifts in the station, so figure out how you're going to be getting down to the platforms beforehand, especially if getting to Incheon. Coming from Kimpo was a breeze as we managed to find the lift straight away from the platform and by doing so unintentionally bypassed going through the turnstiles as we ended up on ground level. Noticed that the lifts are normally for the disabled so we didn't make use of them unless we had luggage. We later found it easier to go to B1 and take the hotel lift up. There are some nice restaurants in the basement levels and an upscale Lotte supermarket that carried local produce to drinks and snacks from around the world. Gongdeok is also has a lot of offices around, so finding a decent place to eat isn't hard.We didn't do Gangnam, so in our case the hotel was a good base to get to the places we were interested in - City Hall area, Hongdae, Dongdaemun, etc.Price was reasonable as it's not in the heart of the city but the lobby debacle aside it didn't disappoint on quality.","January 16, 2018","14    Lotte City Hotel Mapo

808,"The hotel itself was in a great location. While it may have been in a business area, it was easy to get around Seoul because there is a subway station right below the hotel. There was also a supermarket and a few restaurants and establishments below the hotel as well which made it easy for us to grab a quick snack or buy supplies. The staff were friendly as well. My only problem with the hotel is that the temperature of our room was so hot. We visited in April 2017 and the weather in Seoul was pretty cold (ranging from around 10-5 degrees) and I'd understand that they would keep it relatively warm in the hotel, but it was so hot that none of us could sleep properly and we were sweating! We asked multiple times for them to fix it but only on our last night (we stayed for 5 nights) were they able to finally fix the temperature.","December 29, 2017","14    Lotte City Hotel Mapo

The staff was extremely friendly and the service was outstanding.The rooms were more spacious than the one in Myeondong and they were very clean and comfortable. The bed, no disappointment here either. I slept very comfortably. These Lotte City beds have nothing to ask to the ones at the Four Seasons in Dallas Texas. The bathrooms are very nice, spacious with an electronic bidet and a soaker tub with shower combo.The hotel has free fast wi-fi, laundromat, gym and a pool. The location is in a less tourist area, but has direct access to the subway and major avenues. The hotel is on top of a subte complex with restaurants, hair salons, and supermarket.Loved it and I would go back without any hesitation.","October 23, 2017","14    Lotte City Hotel Mapo

813,"I really enjoyed my stay here! I want to return to Seoul, and when I do I'll likely come back to this hotel.The room wasn't huge, but it was well-appointed and didn't feel cramped. There was a fridge and a safe in the room, and the bathroom had a tub and a separate shower (plus a retractable laundry line). Bed was comfortable but on the firm side, as seems standard in Korea. There is a control for all the lights and the A/C next to the bed. The room was really quiet, too (I stayed on the eighth & top floor).Everything in the hotel was very clean and modern, and there's a pretty little pocket park outside with places to sit. Staff was very friendly--I really don't speak Korean well at all, but they spoke or understood enough English that it wasn't a problem.The hotel has a buffet restaurant, which is very good but pricey. It's also located atop a small but complete supermarket and a bunch of casual eateries, so there was no shortage of affordable, convenient, and quite tasty dining options. The airport train stops here, as does a commuter rail and two subway lines (Gongdeok Station), so getting around is super-easy. In addition, there's a big bus stop outside.One thing that I found extremely charming about the hotel is that, because there's a women's clinic in the building, there are TONS of families with small children staying there. If you're hoping for quiet time in the swimming pool (or planning a Spring Break rager), too bad, but I thought all the kids were absolutely adorable. If you're traveling with young family members, I would definitely recommend this place--you'll fit right in!","October 13, 2017","14    Lotte City Hotel Mapo

I claimed back my backpack and luggage and only get to remember about my home currencies in my backpack while on the way to airport. I then realised the whole envelope was gone from my backpack called the hotel reporting the incident. It did surprise me that they called me in less than half an hour informing that they saw nothing wrong from CCTV...I could not help feeling disappointed theft could happen in a hotel of reasonable standing..though I had my carelessness to blame..I do not think I want to stay in this hotel again...,"August 31, 2017","14    Lotte City Hotel Mapo

The staff were polite and helpful, and spoke English. We had a late flight and they were happy to hold our luggage for the day after we had checked out. The bar is overly expensive, as is the breakfast buffet - arrange to eat and drink elsewhere unless you're on the company card.There is a close airport bus pickup, but be aware that the bus does not come to the hotel itself. I would advise having someone point out exactly where the pickup is before you head out to catch the bus, as there are a number of bus stops close by.

The shuttle bus service is really helpful as it goes to Myeongdong, The Palace and Seoul Station. The shuttle bus ajusshi is really friendly, just that he cannot speak English.

851,"This review is made from my personal experience staying here with my aunt from 29 May-1 June 2018 and 4 June-8 June 2018.The good things about this hotel are:1. It is easy to go anywhere because there is a walking distance train station and bus station2. The hotel staffs are helpful3. There is a convenience store and coin laundry in the lobby (TIPS: it is better to do laundry better and cheaper than buying clothes in the street) 4. For smokers, there is a smoking room in every floor5. They have communal kitchen in every floor so you can get some ice and refill your water bottle there, and even you can have hot water for your instant cup noodleThe not so good things, I would not say bad because it is still acceptable:1. Most of the staffs can speak English but sometimes it is a little hard to understand2. There is bad smell in the bedroom after it is being cleaned, maybe because of the cleaning liquid or the unclean mop is used for toilet3. When we were about to leave, we booked a taxi a night before in the lobby but the next morning when we went down to get the taxi., the staff downstairs (the concierge) said there wasn't our names but they took a prompt action to re-book and the taxi came 10 minutes afterwardsOverall, the hotel is an nice place to stay especially for the location.","July 8, 2018","15    Hotel Skypark Kingstown Dongdaemun

A full functioning kitchen with microwave hot water pot and sink. It had 2 bathrooms! You need to put it a deposit for kitchen utensils which was fine. Room was very clean and provided robes for four! New fresh towels everyday. Add location...it was conveniently located in between 2 subway stations equidistant from the hotel - less than 5 minutes walk - which will allow you to conveniently travel to any part of the city by subway. This was a good thing especially in winter when it’s below 0 outside. The hotel sits above a mall - Hyundai City Outlets - which was on the lower floors and right beside another popular shopping mall - Doota Mall. Dongdaemun street market just a few minutes walk away.

867,"I originally booked a twin residence room with my friend. When I got to the hotel, the staff was very helpful and nice and he offered to upgrade us to a triple residence room for free. The location of the hotel is very convenient as it is the same building as Hyundai City Outlets and next to Doota Mall. It's just around 5 minutes walk to the Dongdaemun History and Culture Park subway station and there are a lot of nice food nearby. The hotel also offers free shuttle bus service for hotel guests to other Skypark hotels, Myeongdong and Seoul Station which is very convenient for us with heavy luggages. There is also self-laundry service at the lobby of the hotel which is very convenient for us to wash our clothes any time we like.One thing that I didn't really like about this hotel was their central heating system as I felt very hot and stuffy if I turned on the heater and the temperature has to be set at a very high degree celcius (such as 26 or even 30 degrees) and I couldn't regulate the temperature on my own to fit my needs. I had to turn off all the heaters and open the small windows to have the room with better ventilation. Another thing about this hotel is that when you close the door of the hotel room, there could be a gap and the door may not close properly. So if someone outside passes by or if the wind blows, there could be noise coming from the door. Overall, I did enjoy my stay at this hotel and would most probably consider staying in this hotel again for my next visit to Seoul.","January 2, 2018","15    Hotel Skypark Kingstown Dongdaemun

Breakfast buffet at 7/fl., do not have many choice, and wondering they do not supply sugar for coffee. Hotel room is small but enough to open 2 suitcase, a small tips that better to book with the room with balcony as you pay a little bit more then you can enjoy with a nice outdoor balcony that can have enough place to enjoy the nice view of Dongdaemum.

894,"Positive’s--Hotel is very centrally located - within walking distance of most major tourist attractions. Extremely close to the Myeongdong district - known for its shopping and street food. Also, it’s only a few minute walk to a hop-on/hop-off bus stop-Very safe area-The Reception Desk Manager (Steve?) was very helpful with a last second problem I had upon leaving. I’ll spare you the details, but he went “above and beyond” to fix something that was totally my stupid mistake. That is true customer service at the Floral Hotel at ShinShin!-Water pressure was good - hot water was plentiful-Reception staff spoke good English-Reception staff was very helpful in setting up tours-Heated tile floors were nice-Cable TV had many different channels, including many English speaking-Views outside of the windows were very cosmopolitan – we never closed the curtainsNegative’s--Hated that the bathtub/shower was in the open part of the room (the bathtub/shower did have a curtain, but still it was awful)-There was a coffee/tea maker in the room, but no coffee or tea bags were provided (you can get tea bags from the lobby area coffee machine)-The thermostat was near impossible to control - it didn’t seem to respond to any changes I made-Breakfast buffet was just OK. The scrambled eggs tasted a little like fish (and I don’t like fish). The waitress there was very helpful with tourist recommendationsNot a Positive or a Negative--Room was small, but that’s normal in many Asian countries-Check-in / reception is in the building next door in the basement-It’s a very tall but thin hotel - only three rooms per floor-Toilet is controlled by an electronic panel - luckily there’s an arrow pointing to flush.

There is also airport bus available at the bus stop.The subway station is also not far away, about 5 minutes from the hotel. The room is a bit dusty when we checked in. But it was cleaned after our first night stay. The bed is very comfortable. Room is big enough for two people. There is a long table at the window side which can put a lot of stuffs.As we booked a room without bathtub, it was surprised to see the shower bath does not has a rack or something to place the amenities such as bath gel, shampoo and lotion. The items were placed on the floor, which is not convenient when taking bath. Can imagine it will be difficult for old people or pregnant women to squad down to take the amenities. There is no side table and electric socket at both sides of the bed, which I feel it is not convenient at all. The wash basin is just located right after the room door, which is a bit weird. The lighting in the room was quite dim, difficult for ladies to do their make up. Overall, satisfied stay but just a few issues above.","April 29, 2019","16    Floral Hotel Shin Shin Seoul Myeongdong

896,"We stayed 5 nights in March 2019. The room was very small, with no coffee. Navigation to our room from the front-desk was a challenge also, as there are 2 buildings involved. Those are the negatives of our stay. Everything else was great. The room came with a complimentary breakfast at the buffet on the ground floor. It was simple, but adequate. Scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, rice, breads, cereals, and beverages. The best part of the buffet was our host, Chan-Im Park (spelling??). Chan was great with our 3 year old daughter who became very ill during our stay. Chan was extremely helpful, and took it upon herself to not only find a good hospital (Severance), but call them on our behalf. We took our daughter to the hospital and it was a great experience with the care we received. We want to say Thank You to Chan for her caring assistance. Our daughter also threw up on the bed in our room, and housekeeping got right on the clean-up, without making us feel bad or embarrassed.

905,"Stayed at Hotel ShinShin for 5 nights at the beginning of September with my husband. Check in was quick and easy and the staff were friendly and helpful with good English skills. They even made a restaurant reservation for us which was super helpful as the restaurant is a popular and busy one so it was nice to know that when we arrived we had a table. The rooms are on the small side (but that is to be expected in the middle of Seoul) and featured a very comfortable king size bed. The open shower area is a little weird but if you are travelling with your partner no big deal. Perhaps not ideal if you are travelling with a friend! The environmental policy is great - you leave a card on the bed if you don't want your sheets changed and only want the bed made. Fabulous on a multi night stay. Towels were still changed even though 'hung up' as requested to save on water/power but that seems to happen in most hotels anyway- not sure why! Breakfast at Dinehall is obviously convenient but at 15,000 won per person pricey for what it is, though the quality is ok. They let you pay as you go which is good as we only used it a couple of mornings. The Ubiquitous Paris Baguette is just across the street and open at 7 am so that was a great, cheaper option. The hotel was tricky to find at first (we arrived via the Airport Limousine (Namdameum Martket stop) and spent ages trying to follow Kakao/Google maps to get there. Basically, get off the bus and cross the road as soon as you can (through the underground market is safest!) and look for Ediya Coffee shop (blue signage) on the corner and walk up a few minutes and you cant miss it next to the swanky Sotetsu Splaisir Hotel. Definitely an awesome location as the city hall metro station services 2 lines and there is also a stop on subway line 4 close by too (Hoehyon station I think) Plus you can walk to heaps of places as we did, and you won't be short of food/shopping and market options. Would definitely recommend and stay again. Oh, and they offer a free phone with internet with each room to help you get around. We didn't use it as we had organised a WIFI egg with 2G of data daily (only $5AU per day) to see us thorough our whole trip which we picked up at the airport on the way in, so can't comment on how well it works but it is definitely a useful bonus.","September 17, 2018","16    Floral Hotel Shin Shin Seoul Myeongdong

The hotel is in a great location to more shopping then you could ever want. We got taxis to visit anywhere we wanted. They exchanged money for us. When it came time to leave. The airport bus was just around the corner.

912,"I've previously stayed in another hotel in Seoul with really straight forward train/subway directions to get there. When I contacted the hotel in advance to ask for directions, I was given very vague instructions. Such as, you can take line 1 and get off at city all. That's all. On top of that I was sent half a dozen of limousine bus and cab options. It was not clear and not very helpful.I got better instructions from the airport information counter. The lady at the airport insisted that I take the limousine bus instead as it would stop closer to the hotel. We did as suggested and got off on the opposite side of the main road and had to cross using the underpass without escalators. It was a bit of a workout but we made it across and walked another 150m up an alley to get to the hotel.Ignore the large building before you reach dinehall and a sign with tripadvisor logo. You then walk into the alley next to dinehall. There wasn't an open lobby, we instead had to enter a door behind dinehall and take the elevator down to a basement lobby.Arriving a couple or hours early, we were asked to leave our bags at the lobby and come back later. Reception staff was not very welcoming, it was unpleasant to arrive to faces like that. I was going to assume they didn't speak english, but they did. I got a rather stand offish vibe from them.We left in search of coffee and to explore the area a little. Again, no suggestions from the hotel staff.The room was a little tight but the bathroom wasn't a closet. The bathroom doorknob was broken. Sleep was okay.Sheets and towels were clean.We missed breakfast the first morning and caught a bite the next. Food was basic, not a great spread.

913,"Even before I left for Seoul. I was EXTREMELY IMPRESSED with the staff's PROMPT communication when I emailed them the with questions prior to booking. Once I arrived I found everyone to be helpful in any needs I had during my 10 night stay. I stayed in a deluxe room with a king size bed. My room was on the seventh floor, I had a great corner room with a great view. The mattress is firm but comfortable. There is a TV but I didn't watch it. Rooms were small but clean- perfect for the solo traveler or a couple.The bathtub was deep enough for me (I'm 5'3) to soak in. The shower had nice pressure and I never had an issue with the hot turning cold.Toilet-Separate with a bidet featureThere is plenty of closet space for hanging clothing. I did need extra hangers, which the front desk was kind enough to find for me. You will find an emergency flashlight inside the cabinet and an emergency escape ladder under the bench. The room comes with a hairdryer, and basic shower gel, shampoo, conditioner and lotion. I was sad to see there wasn't an iron. You might have to bring one if you don't want to send your clothing out to be cleaned or pressed. There is a price list for dry cleaning in the drawer of the desk. The room also has one 110V and 120V outlet. You have full control of the heating and cooling system in the room. Wifi worked well.The hotel supplies you with a free cell phone for your stay. I HIGHLY recommend adding the NAVER MAPs app in English for getting around Seoul. You can make free calls to North America with the phone. Breakfast was pretty much the same every day, with a few occasional exceptions. Toast with jams and peanut butterScrambled eggs, Fried Rice, Sausages, American Bacon, Korean soup or porage. Fresh fruit: grapes, pineapple, oranges, kiwi, cherry tomatoesPlain yogurt - I usually added a little jam to mine but I think there was honey or canned peaches. There also was a homemade granola.2-3 Dry Cereals1Green salad (plain) and then one with some type of dressing and meat or seafoodOccasionally there were fried stuffed peppers, Korean pancakes, or fried dumpling as well.Coffee and JuiceThe selection was healthy and diverse enough to start the day. There is also a number of coffee and pastry shops within a block if you're looking for something more. You will also find coffee, tea and cookies in the lobby. Location was the best part of the hotel. It's easy to get around the entire city via the buses or trains. I personally walked everywhere and used cabs a good deal. The hotel staff will help you get a taxi when you need one. (BTW-only use the orange, yellow, white or silver taxi service- the black ones will cost you a fortune). There are several Korean restaurants nearby. 2 convenience stores. A number of coffee shops and cafe.","June 29, 2018","16    Floral Hotel Shin Shin Seoul Myeongdong

915,"I was here with my wife for 1 week between 23/05 - 30/05.Lets write a list of pros and cons in the order I remember them.+/- Airport bus transfer to the hotel took approx 1 hr. The bus had extra wide seats so it was comfortable.+ Check in was quick and painless. As we were on the 10th floor in the opposite building, a member of staff was nice enough to walk us over and into the lift.+ The hotel had catered for our requests and put us in room 1002, which is pretty much as quiet as it's going to get being so central. In the night though, you can still hear traffic from the main junction (especially bikes), but it's bearable even for light sleepers.+ The king size bed was comfortable and takes up most of the room.+ I like how the toilet is in a separate room to the shower.+/- Overall, the size of the room is compact. For a couple it's okay and workable.+/- Immediately I see under the seat was a safety box for use if and when there's a fire and you have to get out via the window (10th floor in my case). It's a kit that you strap into to lower yourself down to the ground. It made me think seriously about what to do in case of a fire and I was glad that the hotel has also considered this.+ The main selling point to this hotel is its location. It's easy walking distance to loads of places, the metro, the market, myeongdong center, the high street for breakfast etc. At least a couple of convenient stores literally just downstairs.+ Housekeeping was always timely and immaculate.- As we were in the other building, we didn't see reception after we checked in apart from the 1 time on the Sunday when we couldn't find a local pharmacy that was open. After consulting with reception and the guy went online to check, he confirmed that pharmacies are not open on Sundays. This turned out to be untrue as we came across several during the course of the day and was able to buy what we needed. I guess reception needed better local knowledge(?)+ The area felt safe and you need to use your key card to access the elevator so no random person can come off the streets into the hotel (or can they if they used the stairs?) Anyway, I felt safe while I was there. Yes, even the small alley behind the restaurants.+ Free use of safe and internet. It's expected, but you'd be surprised how many hotels these days still charge you extra for either.","June 4, 2018","16    Floral Hotel Shin Shin Seoul Myeongdong

918,"Stayed in August but completely forgot to write my experience! Hotel Shin Shin was the place to stay in South Korea, Seoul. it was near the major train station and close to attractions, food, and coffee! I was also able to book this hotel with a third party website and got free breakfast along with our stay. Initially getting there, it was a little tricky, but google map was a huge help. The room we got was a standard double. It's smaller than American rooms, but it's still comfy. We didn't spend much time in the room so the size didn't bother us. Just a place to sleep and shower :)On our first full day, the staff was great with helping us find our way around Korea. We asked them for directions and they were able to provide that with no problem. They also provided us with a card stating their location and phone number and told us to keep it with us at all times in case we decide to call for a cab and need to get a ride back - this would allow our driver to know where to go without having any confusion.Overall, amazing stay! Would definitely stay here again. Great for couples! Breakfast was amazing! Staff was awesome. Thanks Hotel Shin Shin!","March 12, 2018","16    Floral Hotel Shin Shin Seoul Myeongdong

Another short way from the CityHall station, you can walk through a underground shopping (between exit 6 & 7), walk through the shopping area to exit 4 (you will see Starbuck) then turn left at the corner go straight ahead keep left for 200-300 m. You will see the hotel. Hotel surround with restaurants and groceries shops (7/11) and 10 min. walk to Myendong shopping area . You can also use the underground (near starbuck) reach to Myendong The receptionist were very nice and helpful.

920,"Have to say I was quite disappointed, I’m not sure if it’s because I expected to much after reading & seeing the trip advisor reviews / scores or if I’ve been spoilt during my travels. It didn’t live up to my expectations.It is in a fantastic location, near Namdaemun market & close to 2 metro stations (city hall & hoehyeon). The room was ‘compact’ to say the least, the bed however was very comfortable & the shower was good.Attention to detail is missing... They provide a kettle & cups, however no actual tea or coffee. They also provide a handy phone with map facilities for you to use free of charge. Ours however had no charge on it... did ask if they had another we could use with charge, response was no. Staff are polite but not overtly helpful / friendly. Would I stay again or recommend it... sorry but no. ","January 26, 2018","16    Floral Hotel Shin Shin Seoul Myeongdong

We easily got to and from the Airport, the metro was a short distance away as well as the underground shopping pathways. Myeong-dong is basically across the street and everywhere we wanted to get to we could walk or jump on the metro. Namsan park is a short walk from the hotel as well!Staff was very friendly and the room was cozy. We are also obsessed with the restaurant - Dine Hall that is associated with the Hotel. Even though some may think it's pricey, we ate breakfast there almost every day just because it was so good.We would definitely stay here again!","January 3, 2018","16    Floral Hotel Shin Shin Seoul Myeongdong

The room a little small which is not a big issue for me as a hotel room is really just for sleeping. Some may find the open bathroom concept an issue if traveling with friends, but I had no problem with this.Location is central as it's within a two mile radius of many main attractions including the palaces and markets.Issues: When I arrived, the shower would not drain. They sent someone to repair it immediately which resolved the situation for a day, but the issue happened again. Again the fixed it immediately. On one night we lost all water, but fortunately we were out partying until 3AM which didn't really affect us, but it is worth mentioning.","November 23, 2017","16    Floral Hotel Shin Shin Seoul Myeongdong

I had the room with bathtub and the sink is just next to the tub, open space design, and toilet is separated from the sink and tub. Room also super quiet, busy area, with full occupants, but you hardly can hear any noise from outside even inside your room. Do not hesitate, just booked, you won't regret.

Make sure you watch their YouTube videos on how to get to the hotel from the various airport bus stops or from the subway. They are perfect and spot on.I followed the directions and found the hotel with no problem.Check in was easy and the room was clean. I was a solo traveler in a room with two twin beds.

932,"Found the hotel right away after taking Airport Limousine Bus at Namdaemun Market, walk is around 5 minutes, as we had to walk further down to be able to cross the street (It is faster on the way to the airport via limousine bus since there is no need to cross the street). We had our room upgraded to a corner room, above the Dine Hall, as it is brighter, and have a nice view of the Bank of Korea grounds. Room is on the smaller side, but comfortable for two people. The water heater is hard to adjust, as it has a tendency to be so hot. There are many good Korean restaurants nearby, 2 convenience stores, cafes. I like the feel of the neighborhood. It is near the shopping area, Myeongdong, around 5-10 minutes away by walking. It is also walking distance (15-20 minutes or more) to other interesting areas like the Chongyeonchon Stream, and Gyongbeuk Palace. Hotel breakfast included was adequate for me, but am sure for others, it will be considered not much variety. On our last day, it took a while for them to replenish the scrambled eggs and rice. I also have to note that the coffee served with breakfast is too watered down for my taste.I general, the hotel staff were great and helpful in giving out directions in English. Had one incident/misunderstanding with a front desk officer, Steven Yang, as he was very impatient with my queries. Will not elaborate on this review, but I already wrote management about the said incident.. He was rude, but apologized afterwards about his actions. I also got a letter from the management apologizing about the said incident.Overall, it was a good stay.","September 29, 2017","16    Floral Hotel Shin Shin Seoul Myeongdong

In my opinion there was not a large offering for breakfast but then again to be fair, the price for the breakfast wasn't that steep either at £7.The location is very good, however finding the hotel was not easy and might require some forward planning. The hotel does provide information such as maps, instructions and the address in Korean.

It has a great location with awesome food surrounding it. The best part of it it is that, it is tucked in a quiet place even if it's the center of everything. They prepared our room even if we arrived earlier (10am). They also provided us directions on how to navigate our way towards the hotel, this is very helpful as Seoul's train system can be very complex. We fully enjoyed our 10th year anniversary here.

Wine bars are firmly in the nearby 4star hotels. Note that this hotel provides toiletries but not toothbrushes and shavers. There were robes and slippers, and kettle.

943,"Stayed on a combination of business and pleasure for 8 days in the Neo Traditional Suite - brilliant stay, Very helpful staff, fantastic location and lovely Dinehall restaurant.Hotel location is fantastic - located on a sort of 'building' island minutes walk away from the major roads, subways and bus stops. This had the added benefit of making our room on the First Floor very peaceful - no noise - even with sliding door ajar at night. As well as the Suite being a lovely room with wooden floors in the bed/living area, black granite type tiles in the large bathroom, all with underfloor heating, the blissful thing was the two sets of almost floor to ceiling sliding windows you could open to half the width of the window. Billowing net curtains with the delicious breeze meant there was no need for air con with the cross ventilation these open windows provided.The living area at least equal in size to the sleeping area had a comfortable 70s style black sofa, smoked glass topped coffee table and blissful black pouffee to put your legs up on. A long desk area running the length of one wall which has a captain's style chair - very comfortable for working on next to the window. This living area made all the difference for a longer stay made a comfortable and relaxing return from a day's sightseeing or business.The bathroom had a substantial glass door framed with metal with a heavy duty black out curtain that could be pulled across to give 100 per cent privacy. The ample shower space had it's own opaque glass door and the japanese stye toilet also had it's own opaque glass door. Ample area of washstand surface in black granite with two basins and a separate bath. The bath was small but perfectly adequate. Bring your own bubble bath though - hard to find in Seoul. All very clean.The Suite was a luxury that made all the difference.Kettle, mugs and water provided. Fridge. Ample storage space in one wardrobe and another single full length wardrobe a glass door and drawers. Another full length glass storage space with glass shelves and fridge/kettle. Additional two cupboards under the desk Large wall mounted TV. Fast and consistent wifi.We were also offered complimentary laundry - two items a day though think this was linked to the Suite and the use of a brand new looking smartphone free of charge - though heavy penalty if you lost it. Near reception sitting area with complimentary tea, coffee and biscuits - all airconditioned. Great waiting area if you have a later flight and there are two very large spotlessly clean single toilets on the same floor that can be used for changing in very comfortably.The Reception area is in the basement. Recommend you leave your heavy bags upstairs while you check in in case you need to carry them back up again.Dinehall restaurant - great. We paid for the breakfast and were very glad we did and felt it was good value. Despite other reviewers saying there was plenty of alternatives - I did not see them. Buffet Style. There are the daily staples of cereals, locally made yoghurt, fruit and toast and juices and a daily change of local Korean food - simply delicious - and the salad ingredients and fruit so fresh. Coffee or tea - as much as you can drink. We ate here on two nights, there was a good atmosphere and despite a fairly limited menu everything we ordered was freshly prepared and well cooked. Can recommend the Box Chicken - very ample servings for two people. Pizza as well very good and was freshly made. Only problem not open on Saturday night.7 Eleven and 'With Me"" convenience stores within 3 mins walking. Hotel staff very good at ordering taxis that arrive punctually. ATMs in the convenience stores. You can buy Sim Cards here - I bought a Data only sim. Though if I came again I would buy one in the SK Telecom at the Airport, or in the shop near the Hotel as they do it all for you. Getting my Egg data only sim working I bought from the convenience store I found challenging.We took a 'local' taxi (cheaper than the black limousine taxi) directly to the Hotel and it cost approximately 50,000 KRW - a 45 minute to 1 hour trip. Economies of scale made it a luxury well spent. When you come out of the airport avoid the 'black limousine taxis' and go for the local taxi which is cheaper and very comfortable. My husband used taxis to get to his conference and they were very reasonable and waiting for him every morning.Recommend you watch all the You Tube links the Hotel will send you on how to get to the Hotel as useful for spotting landmarks and signs on how to get to Hotel. If you are thiking of getting the subway from the airport, take note of the 3 long flights of stairs to get to ground level.We bought a T Money card - stored value travel card. You can buy them in convenience stores (7 Eleven and With Me 3 mins from Hotel). They were invaluable - use on underground and buses. Recommend you download a Seoul Subway App - invaluable - plans trip for you - tells you how long it will take and much it will cost. Extremely re-assuring for anyone visually challenged as the subway maps on the stations the writing is too small for me! Very easy to get around. Google maps or some reason will not give you the 'walking' option but if you press bus it will give you a map and will also give very accurate and easy bus information It will also follow the route as you are on the bus so you know when to get off. Without it use of buses would be challenging! Learn from my experience and make sure you get on the right side of the road!If you think you would like to visit the absolutely stunning Palaces - buy a combination ticket for 10,000 KRW - very good value. Palaces also offer free guided tours in English but would recommend you arrive before the start of the tour and have a good look round yourself first as not much time for taking photos and drinking in the atmosphere and buildings on the tours.We absolutely loved our trip to Seoul - such an unexpected delight - made all the more comfortable and memorable because of our stay in wonderful HotelShinShin.","May 1, 2017","16    Floral Hotel Shin Shin Seoul Myeongdong

The room has both 220V and 110 V outlets which helped with our recharging cell phones and wheelchair every night. The room and the bathroom were very clean and the cleaning service was prompt and meticulous.The staff was extraordinarily helpful and friendly. One night a staff member helped fix my wheelchair front wheel with an Allen wrench. Another time a different staff member helped tighten the handle bar. On our day of check-out, yet another staff member pushed two of our suite cases to the airport shuttle stop.

If you use another exit on the same side of the street, you can use the escalator which is especially handy if you have luggage. Very easy to get to the hotel from Seoul Station. Myeongdong shopping district is very close, just a few blocks away, but if you don't like crowds and the noise, it's easy to avoid it. Namdaemun is within walking distance, Dongdaemun just a few metro stops away.Rooms are typical, quite small. If you're lucky, you will have a window with a view but most likely you won't. Free wifi worked well and the staff was friendly and helpful. Apparently they offer breakfast for an additional fee but it's served in the Paris Baguette next door.My biggest complaint is that the beds are quite uncomfortable.

There was only one thing that bothered us, and it was the very warm temperature of the room at night time. We were there right smack in the middle of a cold wave when we were in Seoul but we were sweating at night. It was not just war, it was hot!! We definitely turned off the heater, and I asked the Front Desk if there was a way to adjust the very warm temp but no AC was understandably available as it was still winter. I will return to this hotel in the summer but having second thoughts on going there again in winter. Other than that, I love this hotel.Tip: Myeongdong Station Exit 9 is right in front of the hotel but it is all stairs so its a killer if you have baggage. What we did was go out using Exit 7 which has elevators or Exit 1 (across the street from hotel) which has both elevators and escalators.

It can be a bit stressful to pack your stuff and to walk around ( 2 ppl in a room) I feel that if u stayed there as a solo traveller it may be a bit better, we came there at a (-8) to -15 celsius so , sleeping at night ( the air from the window really makes the room so cold.. Its like we were freezing while we sleep ( there is no heater .. ) that really makes us feeling uncomfortable. ( this would be a reason why i wouldnt recommend this place. )However, the service here are excellent , the hotel ppl are so nice and verbal in english. Its just a matter of the hotel building itself. Its very convenient having 7eleven and a bakery cafe connected to the hotel. ( i highly recommend the rooibus tea) the place is located strategically not far away from myeongdong street ( its just behind the hotel..) if u want to be more near to all the shopping area i would recommend to reside at Skypark 2 , the place seems more bigger ( i think) The other plus point abt this place would be having the shuttle bus ( 6015) 2 mins walk from the hotel ( just near to standard charted bank walk a lil further) the bus will take u to incheon airport for (15 000 won and u just pay the driver directly no need to buy a ticket in advance ) and it comes often like every 20 mins so u dont have to use the hotel van or bus ( it costs more plus additional charges for luggage. So really just take the airport bus.

992,"Pros:(1) Easy access from Incheon airport - take bus 6015. Travelling time is about 70 mins subjected to traffic condition. The bus was comfortable and had announcements in Korean, Japanese, Chinese and English upon arriving your hotel. Bus stop is only a stone away. There is a ramp next to the front steps of the hotel for luggage. (2) Paris Baguette Cafe at the lobby level if you are a coffee lover; not bad at all. They also sell Korean style breads and cakes. 7-11 at the back of the corridor for quick snacks and emergency items.(3) Nearby attractions - Myeongdong shopping for beauty products and lots of eating places around the area. Walking distance to Namsan tower cable car station(Uphill all the way). Highly recommend the newly opened Daiso just opposite the hotel. Eight levels of gadgets and stuff that you will adore.(4) Metro Myeongdong Station Exit 9 is outside. Warning: not for people with bad knees as there are many steps to climb. Can try to use exit 7 which has an escalator but some steps are still required.(5) Good Wifi speed. A hot/cold water dispenser at each level and ice machine on level 2. Business Centre at the basement; two old PC's and a printer. It is better to use your own device in your room. Cons:We had a twin room which is very small. Cannot walk through with the suitcase opened. The wardrobe is tiny too.Pillows are too soft for me.","November 11, 2017","17    Hotel Skypark Myeongdong III

994,"The staff were just fabulous as well as the rooms. The staff were very helpful and they can speak English well. I took Airport Limousine Bus from Incheon Airport to the hotel and it was very easy! The bus stopped just right in front of the hotel. The receptionist was very helpful and friendly, and everything about check-in had been settled in less than 5 minutes. I requested for an iron + iron board and an international power adapter. Excellent location of the hotel as it is located in the center of Myeongdong Shopping Street. The subway (Seoul Metro) station were just right in front of the hotel (Exit 9). It was also easy to take bus from here (I took bus to Namsan Seoul Tower). Since it was located at the Myeongdong area, we didn't find any difficulties to find Halal Restaurants at night. Our favourite were Busan Jib and Gurkha Restaurant. There were also some Halal street food. Walking and shopping at night around this area was very safe especially for ladies. No bumpy pavements, 7 Eleven was connected to the hotel lobby. Room itself was well equipped and comfortable --bathroom with separate toilet and shower room, toilet with bidet, bathrobes, enough space to open our luggage, TV with many channels, bottled water, kettle+ coffee & tea set, complimentary toiletries (shower gel, lotion, shampoo, conditioner, toothpaste, toothbrush).It was very easy to book taxi as the taxi will stop just right in front of the hotel.

However, the room is terrible, once I open the door, I find out the room havn't include the window. Since my room between the two walls, I even can't see any view through the windows. The room is really hot (room temperature over 34""c) due to they offer us a heater when we are travelling in winter. We required to have a Air Purifier, however, they told us too much guest required, they can just offer us a fan. This is the first experience I sweat when I sleep in those few days.

1000,"This review is for two separate stays in Hotel Skypark Myeongdong III in May17.The main categories I will cover in my review are as follows:Location - The hotel is relatively easy to reach via the airport shuttle bus, which I took directly from outside Incheon Airport. At the same stop, you can catch a shuttle bus to Gimpo Airport should you require a flight out to perhaps Jeju. Apart from the ease in getting to and from the main airports, this hotel is mere steps away from a subway station which makes it super duper convenient as a base from which you can hop on and off the subway to explore the other areas. Do note that the entrance to / exit from the subway station right outside the hotel requires you to climb steps. Hence, should you be moving luggages or have elderly folks with you, try to locate a different exit with lift services or an escalator. And if that is not enough to speak volumes about its convenient location, for all you shopaholics, Myeongdong market is right at your doorstep. Indulge in all the shopping you wish, snack on street food, drop off your loot and repeat the cycle. The hotel is also located within walking distance to the cable car station that will take you to Namsan Tower.Hotel services - Hotel staff has relatively good command of English. Check in and out is fuss free. House keeping is of usual good standard. What I like is that the hotel is able to hold on to your luggages while you take off for a few days to neighboring areas like Jeju / Busan. That said, I did have a second leg of stay with them. Hence, that may be why they were able to hold on to my luggages. It would be best to check with them beforehand should you require luggage storage services. Hotel room - Room itself is pretty compact. Not much space to move about but it is functional enough in my opinion. Standard luggages can be opened up, with covers propped against wall and not fully laid flat on the ground if you get what I mean. Not a problem as I can deal with it. All in all, a good and fuss free stay with Hotel Skypark Myeongdong III!","July 25, 2017","17    Hotel Skypark Myeongdong III

1005,"I read some positive about the hotel before travelling to Seoul. Though i still had some doubts when on the plane, the hotel far surpassed my expectations after staying there during my trip. Travelling to and from the hotel was super convenient — there is an airport limousine bus stop right outside the hotel. It is also situated above Hoehyeon Station, so travelling around by subway is no hassle at all. Across the street is Namdaemun market, turn right and both Shinsegae Department Store and the main Myeongdong shopping area are within walking distance. The hotel was also visible from Seoul Station / Lotte Mart; it goes without saying I will try walking towards that side on my next visit. Front desk staff were very helpful — there was both Chinese and English speakers so communication was not a problem at all. The room was clean and spacious, and I had a view to N Seoul Tower, though soundproofing wise it could be improved as i could hear the doors of the other rooms closing in the mornings. One thing i was most impressed about was the housekeeping — I went out after 11am on one of the days during my stay, and though I returned to find my room not yet made up 3 hours later, when I went out after a short rest and returned again perhaps 4 hours later, the room was already made up! I also felt it was very sweet of the housekeeping staff to keep the water bottles out of the freezer for me from the third day onward; they had picked up on the fact that I don’t like to drink ice cold water and prefer some at room temperature for drinking. My room did not come with breakfast, but that is perfectly fine as there are plenty of food options close to the hotel.Overall a very pleasant stay. I will no doubt shortlist the Tmark Grand Hotel again for future visits to Seoul. :)","July 7, 2019","18    Tmark Grand Hotel Myeongdong

1025,"My second stay in Tmark Grand Hotel Myeongdong was as pleasing as my first stay. This time, I booked a family twin room for 4 nights. We were fortunate enough to have given a room with the Namsan view (and of course the N Seoul Tower). The housekeeping were courteous and did their job well. The room was almost spotless despite the towel and the bedding were a little worn. And I loved that there was a window in the room so that I could feel the fresh air and outside temperature. (Perhaps we were lucky, unlike other reviewers' experience, we could adjust the air-con temperature, and there were pencil and notepad in the room.) The receptionists were responsive and efficient. The janitors were busy cleaning the lobby very early every morning. The convenient store on the lobby floor was a plus especially when we needed to top up our T-money cards. The grill house closed down, and is now replaced by a Burger King store.Myeongdong (the shopping malls and many shopsss), Seoul Station (Lotte Mart!) and City Hall are all within 15-minute walk from the hotel. Airport bus 6001 stops right outside the hotel entrance (within 10-second walk). Besides the nearby metro station (Oh right, the elevator at Exit 1 was closed when we headed back at night. Perhaps that at Exit 4 is more reliable), there was also direct bus from Hongik University that stops right outside the hotel.With its central location, I chose not to pre-book the hotel breakfast but enjoyed the various local eateries in Namdaemum Market. There are very nice coffee, chicken soup, fish cake, pig knuckles, noodles, buns, fish pots in the market, not to mention the bewildering array of products available there. If location matters to you, and you prefer less hectic and more local ambiance, this is the right hotel for you.","May 27, 2019","18    Tmark Grand Hotel Myeongdong

But I believe this is a must!Pros & cons:Pros:* close to Namdaemun* close to shoppingCons:* room temperature! No adjusting... apparently this is only controlled by the building management. They decide how hot or cold you’re room will be. During my stay, it’s 28’ in my room while it’s 27’ outside. Maybe their policy is to just pretty much match whats the temp. Outside...? So basically no room air conditioner. Might as well just open the window. Its cooler that way.* no LOTION! have you ever heard of a 4 star hotel without lotion? And when I ask for it, they seem shock that I need some. They politely send me some but... a small 1oz bottle and that is it! I guess they figure you don’t need lotion since you will be sweating and be pretty moisturized with your own sweat with the heat inside your room due to poor air conditioning.* no face towel, no bar soap! Again have you beed to a hotel with no face towel and bar soap? They give you this liquid soap dispenser but since no towel to use to scrub yourself, you have to use your own hands to lather yourself up!* they advertise they have a swimming pool but get this... you have to pay to get in! Have you ever heard of a 4 star hotel that charges to use the pool? i feel its like those budget airlines... i e saying you get what you paid for... but I thought I paid regular price.* no ethernet cable! They have the sockets in the room but apparently if you don’t have your own cable, you are out of luck! They said they don’t have cable at all... the whole building don’t have cable! Only wireless.* the room is small and dusty!* we booked and paid for a double room. When we checkin, they said their out of it, so they gave us a 2- twin room. I have to sleep in separate bed with my wife! In the next 3 nights! How can this be... then I ask reception if I can be transferred to a double room when its available. She said it is not likely that they will have one. * their bath robes is like 30 year old robes. It looks old!* their in room sleepers are almost made out of paper...* no pen or paper in the room. So if you want to write a love letter or something... you are SOL!I think this is enough for now as my stay is not over yet. Lets see what else can happen.... So if I were you, will you still be staying on this hotel?Like I said in the title... Unbelievable!","May 25, 2019","18    Tmark Grand Hotel Myeongdong

1033,"Pros: - Tmark grand Hotel is accessible, conveniently located beside Hoehyeun station and right across from Namdaemun Market. -- bus stops right in front of the hotel and taxis are constantly passing by-- airport express bus stop is also across from the hotel -- friendly, helpful staff. They gave us directions to where we needed to go and even recommendations on local eats! -- clean room, new sheets everyday CONS: -- I was disappointed that access to the pool is only reserved for guests staying on the 18th floor (Executive Level Floor) and it costs 16+ for all of the other guests. This in a city where spas cost less than that. --- it would've been super convenient if guests were offered a flat fee breakfast. Granted the market was only across the street but having breakfast available to guests in the hotel goes a long way. All in all, it was a great experience. Highly recommended!

Tmark Grand is a 5-10 min walk from Myeongdong and right across the street from Namdaemun Market so the walk is full of stops and sights anyway. For the price of this hotel, it simply can't be beat.

1042,The hotel is excellent for the good location and super convenient to travel around Seoul. The subway and bus station is just in front of the hotel. We took airport limousine and reach the hotel doorstep in just 30mins. It is located just in between Myeongdong shopping district and Seoul Station. I had a triple room and it is spacious with a nice view of Namsan tower. We were there during the Spring season however the air condition was not turn on and felt bit stuffy. Good thing is that there is a button to open the side window to allow fresh air to flow in. The staff were friendly and we had no issue in communicating in English with them.

1046,The good points are the location which is fantastic right opposite the Namdaemun Market and a 5 minute walk to the centre of Myeong-dong. The standard of the room is also very good with nice touches like robes. Most hotels I have stayed in allow a slightly earlier check in especially when guests have been travelling for over 15 hours. We were told the hotel was full so this was impossible so we went for a walk for a while. This however clearly wasn’t the case. The staff waited till the clock exactly hit 2pm to check in customers leading to a long queue of guests who could have checked in at 1:30-1:45 etc. It just seemed a bit mean and petty. Secondly the air con didn’t work and the heat in our room was saying 28-29oC during the night. We had to open the window and put cold towels on us! Not really very good as it made it very uncomfortable. If these two issues were solved I would rate a 9/10,"April 24, 2019","18    Tmark Grand Hotel Myeongdong

1049,"The best thing abt this hotel is the location. Subway, airport bus, Seoullo, shopping and food are right at its doorstep. The room is comfortable and spacious. However for my room, there was a bad smell that got progressively worse as the days went by. The walls are thin so you can hear your neighbours quite clearly (and vice versa). There's a bar next to the hotel so at night it can get a little noisy. So it might be gd to request for a room further away fr that side of the hotel if you're particular.","April 22, 2019","18    Tmark Grand Hotel Myeongdong

1050,"Stayed in this hotel for 3 nights. Room was lovely and comfortable. Bed very good and all neat and clean, including toiletries.Breakfast was excellent with both Korean and Western dishes and great variety.Big disappointment, as many others have stated, was excessive heat in the room, (reached 30 Celsius, at one point), and doesn’t allow for any control in the room. When I complained, hotel immediately sent a large fan, which helped a lot. Windows do open, but that makes it noisy.Also had a defective light which kept turning on and off all night. When I told the desk, a technician came immediately and disconnected it. So, all in all, hotel was very nice. Would I stay again?

1051,"There's nothing to complain with the room and the facilities. Everything is perfect, but...!First of all, the people from the cold countries must understand those from the hot countries that ""We don't want to stay in a warm room, I mean - too warm"". The only problem of this hotel is that the temperature in the room is not adjustable according to the guests' requirement. They have a temperature control unit in the room but it does nothing, except turning it on and off. When we first arrived, the temperature outside was about 15°C so the hotel turned on the heater which made the room warmer - too warm. My friend's room temperature went up to almost 30°C!!! The problem was solved by an electric fan!!! By the way, I was told later that the window could be opened and that helped solving all the problem. I just simply left the window opened and turned off the temperature control. That seems to be a minor thing but considering that you paid a lot of money to buy comfort during your trip, this can disturb your mind.

There are so many, like, ridiculously many places to eat, drink and shop at within 5 metres of the hotel, it's really ridiculous. Also, the room itself is clean, the bathroom so new (the silver goods are sparkling, I don't know how they maintain it so I guess it's all brand new) and the bed so comfy. They provide 2 bottles of water daily, the TV shows superb (I love Korean TV but they have English channels too) and most importantly, it just felt so so good to come back to every time!

1065,"Stayed in this hotel for 4 days 3 nights over December. Room was small but functional. I liked the separate toilet and bathroom and considering the smallish size, I was impressed with the deep bath tub they had in the bathroom space. The shower area was also a good size. I was especially pleased that I did not have small little tubes of conditioner or shampoo that I had to squeeze from, instead the hotel provided decent bottles of shampoo, conditioner and body wash which were refilled regularly. The bath towels were a little thin but the bed was comfortable and there were enough pillows. But the big plus must surely be the wonderful location. Situated within 7 min walk to the train station, the area comes alive at night with food stalls that sold everything from twisted potatoes to beef rice to lobster on a stick. The night life was vibrant with food stalls as well as shopping stores which sold SGD1 socks to SGD10 backpacks. The location was really a big plus for a newbie to Seoul as I was surrounded by food and shopping and convenience. ","December 28, 2018","19    Solaria Nishitetsu Hotel Seoul Myeong-dong

1066,"Situated in the heart of the shopping district of Myeong Dong, just 5 minutes walk away from the nearest metro station. Stayed for 7 nights and enjoyed every single bit. Room was spacious and comfy, being on the 13th floor, our room has a fantastic view facing the Cathedral. Breathtaking when you get to see it snowing in the morning.Amenities are everywhere, you have tons of convinience stores everywhere, a mini supermarket nearby, lots of korean eatery around and at night, street stalls are open selling scrumptious korean street food.There is an ice machine on our floor so getting our drinks chill is not a problem at all. The machine doubles up as a hot/cold water dispenser so drinking water is not a worry.Truly enjoyed our stay, highly recommended and definitely will revisit next time we head to Myeong Dong.","December 26, 2018","19    Solaria Nishitetsu Hotel Seoul Myeong-dong

1067,"Nearly everything met our expectation1. location was walking distance to train, shopping, eating areas, etc2. Hotel had a bathtub (ideal for those who need bath instead of shower)3. Nearly everything that you need, they have thought of and provided.4. Separate automated toilet from the bath (definite plus for twin or triple room)However, there are 5 things that would have made this hotel stay perfect1. Newer bath towels. The towels looked and felt quite worn. Especially after the nice bath, you want a nice bath towel to dry. Hotel should review their towel replacement cycle.2. The rooms are fairly small. Hence, it is ideal for travelers with smaller bags or single user in room. For twin or triple, it might get a little tight. Should have booked bigger premium rooms for triple share.3. Hotel should have warned us about no access by car from 10 am - 11 pm everyday. This means that if you are not a light traveler, you will have to drop off somewhere near and walk with all your stuff to the hotel. For those intending to take the train and walking there, this is ideal.4. Static electricity - you will get a shock if you tap on the door lock with your card immediately. You might want to touch the door to earth yourself before unlocking with key card.5. Buffet Breakfast - most of the time, you will not be bothered by this since there are so many eateries around the hotel. However, if you do not want the hassle of going out for breakfast, the breakfast was fairly poor for KRW22,000. For this price range, a better variety to accommodate the different travelers choice of menu. Hotel should review either the variety or the price.I think point number 3 should have been highlighted earlier so that travelers coming by car would not be surprised and have a negative first impression trying to find the hotel while lugging the bags.Overall, I think I had a bad first impression because of hunting for the hotel after a long day. Arriving to static electricity when first unlocking the door and finding the room small for my luggage. But at least, there was enough positive during the stay at the hotel to recover from the negative impression. I believe if the 5 points were taken care of through some improvement and managing of expectation, the stay at this hotel would be perfect.","December 15, 2018","19    Solaria Nishitetsu Hotel Seoul Myeong-dong

The room is relatively small but if you had been to Japan, it's a size like Japan hotels.There is also a room on each floor where you can refill your water bottle if the bottles the hotel had provided ran out. So you do not need to worry about having insufficient water for the day.

1071,"I travel around 4 months of the year so I know what hotel standards should be. Living in Japan I know the service to be great and having travelled to Korea a few times before I had never been impressed. Saw great reviews for this hotel but I won't be back.The pros are nice location for shopping but not for business. All the local restaurants are tourist traps.On checking in I was given a twin room, but they would not swap for a double bed unless paid. You ask for an iron and you have to bring it yourself , not something you associate with 4 star hotels.I didn't book breakfast with my agent so I paid at reception. At about 25 USD per day, the breakfast is probably the worst I've seen.No fresh fruits , frozen berries one morning. No decent bread, your find better in a supermarket.You may find bibimbap but no bacon? No egg section but dried scrambled eggs.I was checking out at 6am and breakfast starts at 7. I asked for a takeaway box, something they don't do. I then asked for a refund and was told no. After asking the manager they finally did it.Won't be back sadly.","September 10, 2018","19    Solaria Nishitetsu Hotel Seoul Myeong-dong

1072,"I enjoyed my stay at this hotel so much that i decided to write a review even though almost a year has passed. I particularly appreciate how helpful the staff were when i needed translation from korean to english and one of the staff even helped me to call a restaurant to confirm if they are opened as it was during the Chuseok holiday. The room was spacious and clean. Bed and pillow was comfortable. Being a Japanese hotel, they had automated toilet (which gives me a scare sometimes when the cover closes on its own haha). Location is good and you dont have to worry about food or shopping as you are right in the midst of Myeongdong shopping street. The famous Myeongdong Kyoja is just opposite the hotel, super convenient. The bus stop for the airport limousine is also just 3mins walk away.

1073,"We booked 2 rooms- the Hollywood bed and Standard Twin and stayed for 5 nights at Solaria Nishitetsu. The size of the rooms is just right and as a lot of the reviewers have ready mentioned, they have toto toilets. One thing that I would loved to have in the hotel is a coin operated laundry area, so that I could do the laundry in the evening. Another thing to take note of is that your key card only works for your floor. If you have other family members who are booked in another floor, they will have to fetch you.We loved how it is right in the middle of the foodie places we want to visit and is in close proximity to several modes of transportation. You can also easily access some restaurants in M Plaza from the elevator (Floors 4-6) as well.We will definitely be back here and we can see why it has received good reviews and awards.

The rooms are a nice size and well appointed - as everyone talks about, the hotel is Japanese so they also have the Toto toilets installed. The lobby is on the 20th floor, which is a nice space and the staff are nice and helpful.

1076,"Just came back from a 5 nights stay in this hotel with my family. We booked 3 rooms, and we had a great experience. This hotel reminds me a lot of Japanese hotels. Pros:- great location right in the smack of myeongdong. Very close to famous restaurants ( Myeongdong Kyoja, James cheese ribs, Issac toast, gogung, wangbijib BBQ and many more!) - very clean(kudos to housekeeping)- loved the toiletries - the toilet bidet was amazing(best ever!)- staff were friendly(they speak multiple languages like Japanese, Chinese and English)- loved the toilet layout - view was great - many complained about the AC, but we had no problem. We could control it on our own. - room size was sufficient for 2 adults considering the hotel location to be in the center of town. Cons:- no cars were allowed to stop in front of the hotel at a certain timing. Nearest Location for taxi drop off/pick up is Myeongdong station Exit 8(about 3 minutes walk). - breakfast can be improved(more variety), or price can be reduced as it was quite pricey. -no gymAll in all, we will definitely come back to stay in this hotel~ ","June 11, 2018","19    Solaria Nishitetsu Hotel Seoul Myeong-dong

1077,"Came here for a long weekend with my mom and sister. Arriving and leaving from the hotel can be tricky especially if you have plenty of luggage as cabs/cars cannot drop you outside the hotel. Wished it was flagged up on the website. Note: check-in is at the reception on 21st floor rather than at the ground floor. Location wise, its smack in the middle of Myeongdong surrounded by shops/cafes/restaurants. Very convenient if you are shopping and have plenty of bags to drop off; also close to Lotte/Namdaemum market and a short cab ride to Dongdaemum market. Hotel is modern, rooms are a little too small for me though and could do with some touch up/refurb given the high traffic of tourists staying there.

I finally had to go through the side door with escalator as much as 3 floors carrying luggage before i came in to the lift and go to the receptionist, and i like the receptionist is very friendly and I can leave my suitcase before the hotel check-in time (i sent request early check in by E-Mail but there is no answer).The advantages:1. right in the middle of myeongdong, the distance from myeongdong station and the airport bus stop to the hotel not too far away.2. the size of the rooms are quite spacious, the spacious bathrooms that provide toiletries and facial treatments. 3. there is a sofa on the edge of the window so I can look at shops in myeongdong. 4. soft mattress and pillow and temperature that fits in the room. 5. what I liked most was the Bathup water filling so fast I could soak my feet after walking around in Seoul. unfortunately I did not take the breakfast package so I can not review the food.

I hope the hotel can make the change and not make a big fuss over this as I genuinely pressed enter by mistake on the keyboard which meant payment went through without being able to double check on my choice! I hope Japanese culture is as they say as lovely and kind and I hope they change my room without making a big deal. As this is our honeymoon and we will be visiting from 14-17th May, I hope it doesn't disappoint even before we get there. Let's hope the hotel responds back 2 of my emails.

1080,"My wife and I stayed in this hotel at the beginning of October 2017 for 2 nights. This review is a little late, but it was such a fantastic stay that I had to write something. Location: The hotel is in the bustling center of Myeong-dong, which has 100s of shops and restaurants for you to choose from. A great ambience generally in the area, especially when the street food market is on during the weekend. Really a fantastic location.Service: Great service when we arrived at the hotel, although after a long flight we arrived at 10:30 and hoped to get into the room earlier than our allotted time of 12pm for check-in, but no luck. I suppose it was a busy weekend as it was a national holiday, but would have been nice to get in the room a little earlier. The staff however, were very friendly and helped get us settled in the lobby.Room/Hotel: The views from the hotel are amazing, pretty much every place you look there are floor-to-ceiling windows with a great view of the city. The room was perfect - not too small (as I had been warned that many rooms in Seoul were on the smaller side), the whole place felt clean, well furnished, and pristine. Bed was great, bathroom was lovely, and the amenities plentiful.Value: For the amount of money I paid for this room, I'd say it's an absolute steal. Great location, great lobby, staff and room, and fantastic ambience. A fantastic stay in the center of Seoul!","March 28, 2018","19    Solaria Nishitetsu Hotel Seoul Myeong-dong

Other than in the early morning, the surrounding roads are closed to traffic, so you will have to handle your own luggage coming in and going out of the hotel.The hotel is on the upper floors of Forever 21 and right next to Artbox, opposite Myeongdong Kyoja.Lobby : right near the top of the hotel on the 21st floor. It's great that all guests have an opportunity to see a nice view, facing east and west on both sides of the building, instead of limiting it to the more expensive rooms. Nicely decorated with seating areas.Room : we had a triple room. The layout was good with the toilet and bathroom placed at the entrance, quite far away and not in direct line of sight from the beds. This was good as switching on the bathroom lights did not disturb others sleeping. There was lots of storage space, with 2 cupboards & bedside chests. There were 2 pillows on each bed; 1 hard and the other softer. Great option as pillow firmness is a very individual choice.Bathroom & toliet : the bathroom had 2 sinks with lots of horizontal space to place toliteries. There was both a bathtub and shower. The toilet is in a separate room from the bathroom, Japanese-style, and is equipped with a bidet.Amenities : each room has its own individual router, which was much faster than the hotel's general Wi-Fi.

There is also a 24hr mart less than 5 mins walk away but stuffs are overpriced there.2. Clean room. Separate shower and toilet.Cons:1. No shelter when it rains.2. No access road during normal day times. Made it hard to take a taxi to and fro hotel, especially when you have large and heavy luggages.3. Told the staff to help us get a taxi from the main road to airport but was told they don’t offer such service and we need to pay double for hotel taxi if we need their help.4. Centralized aircon and was set to 26°C. We are sweating in the room and can’t adjust it at all.Do take note that myeong dong station do not have lifts and escalator are always down so I have to carry my luggages up 3 flights of stairs and then squeeze through the crowded myeong dong just to get to the hotel.While the stay is ok, I won’t be returning for another stay as there are more cons factors around the small details that made me felt that I can get a better and more accessible hotel at the same price in Seoul.","November 17, 2017","19    Solaria Nishitetsu Hotel Seoul Myeong-dong

And only few minutes walk to Subway exits 7 & 8 & Airport Limousine bus-stop.2. Modern, luxurious, very well designed & functional; with top quality fittings.Excellent shower fittings. Auto control panel for all lights, aircon,etc. Good accessories eg good toiletries, slippers, comfortable bathrobes. Even an air humidifier provided. 3. Alot of power points. No problem to charge all your mobile devices & powerbanks. And there are 2 types of adapter points ( round pin & flat pin). Very thoughtful & useful accessories. Rarely found in other hotels.4. Bright & well lit tastefully designed cosy rooms, yet not glaring. Unlike many hotels which are dim with insufficient lightings.4. The different staff we met during our stay were warm, friendly & helpful. Great service - duty staff came immediately when we called regards humidifier problem. They always smile & acknowledge you when seeing guests on ground floor lobby.5. Good security. Lobby on 21st floor whereas rooms are from 7-24th floors. Access to rooms floors only possible by tapping room key cards on lift on any floorsCons1.Bed was a little on the hard side. 2 sets of pillows were provided. One too hard & other too soft. Something in between would be more comfortable.2. The aircon was put automatically to heater mode during this period. Although it was cold outside ( about 15-18°C), it was pretty warm in room with heater on. Cannot adjust to cold mode unlike other hotels.Hope the cons factors could be improved.We had 2 different rooms as we checked out after 2 nights to go to Busan, & returned for balance 3 nights. Both rooms were similar but at different floors.At the ground floor lift lobby entrance, a 3 Stars rated sign sits below the hotel name.In our opinion, this hotel is 4 to 4.5 stars!

1091,"This is my 2nd time stay in Solaria within these 2 months, and in my recent stay on 28 Oct, I was quite upset when I can't be arrange in upper floor, double bed room and prefer not at the corner.Though the front Desk is very polite , but not helpful at all, and only tell me sorry they can't make it, finally I was being arrange on the 7th floor. But then the next day at 9am, it is very noisy due to the contraction on the 6th floor of the shopping mall.I called the front desk again, and luckily Mr Hatano picked up my call, he has very good English and come up to my room to check. He immediately asked the workers to pause for half an hour and arrange another room for me before I have to go out. Further to that, though he is the manager of the hotel, he personally come up and help me to move my stuff to the new room.It's so impressed with his excellent service , it totally changed my unpleasant image on the first day.However , the next date when I called taxi, problems comes again , the same polite lady that serve me the 1st day , help me to chase the taxi, but the taxi late for 10'minutes , though she keep saying sorry but really don't help .I really hope every staff in Solaria has the same service standard as Hatano.","November 2, 2017","19    Solaria Nishitetsu Hotel Seoul Myeong-dong

The hotel has all my needs and for that it will always be the best:-Easy access to/from Incheon airport with the 6015 shuttle bus-Located in Myeongdong which has a massive selection of restaurants, many skincare and fashion stores and streetfood-Easy to get to all touristic areas- Bukchon Vilkage, N Tower, Gyeongbukgung Palace, Insadong (only found CoEx mall/Gangnam a bit far to get to from here)Plus the staff at the hotel are always willing to help, the room is clean, well maintained and the amenities are always well stocked.","October 28, 2017","19    Solaria Nishitetsu Hotel Seoul Myeong-dong

1093,"Solaria Nishitetsu in Myeongdong is situated right in the heart of the Myeongdong shopping area. It is very accessible with the Myeongdong and Euljiro 1 MRT stations within walking distance from the hotel. The hotel has a minimalist modern design. I like that the bathroom and toilet are separated. The room itself is spacious enough and it even was able to include a bathtub in the bathroom. A small detail that impressed me is the bathroom mirror that doesn’t fog when I use hot water when showering. The middle area of the mirror stays clear and not affected by the steam at all, like magic! My room was made up everyday and I find that the housekeeping personnel does a good job in ensuring that the room is clean and arranged. I stayed in the 17th floor and had a good view of the Myeongdong Cathedral. I would recommend this hotel to other travellers who would like to stay in the Myeongdong area and I myself would stay here again should I be in Seoul the next time round.","October 11, 2017","19    Solaria Nishitetsu Hotel Seoul Myeong-dong

1095,"As expected, the rooms were small.It is clear that regardless if your room is ready or not, they will only check you in at 2:00PM.Breakfast “process” is very inefficient. You have to go to the receptionist to get a coupon before entering the breakfast venue. Why not have the staff at the breakfast venue just give you the coupon upon giving your room number?Don’t also bother asking for any other kind of egg because the “chef” will not accommodate your request. You eat only what they have in the buffet.WIFI IS HORRIBLE! We’ve been here for 5 full days and it drops every 5-mins. You are better off getting wifi from a close network.Doubt if I will ever come back here. Hospitality & Customer Service is most certainly not their norm.

1106,"It was my first time staying in Myeongdong and it was also my first time staying in a Japanese hotel. I was caught off guard. Not by any bad experiences, but by how much a hotel stay can be this wonderful and memorable. Solaria Nishitetsu is located just above M Plaza, right in the middle of the bustling street of Myeongdong. However, the soundproofing of the hotel was so good, that you could not even hear a single noise from the streets. The ambience of the hotel was extremely great too. The mixture of the warm lights and the dark coloured furniture made you feel cosy when in the room. The bathroom was nonetheless very clean and the bathtub was sparkling clean! I might have stayed in the females' floor as my room was provided with facial masks and facial lotion too. I was also amazed by the provision of a humidifier, linen water and shoe cleaner gloves as well. Very impressive!The toilet seat is automated and separated from the bathroom. Some might find it weird but I thought it is a rather efficient arrangement as it separated the use of the toilet and the bath facilities and you can't blame your travel partner for hogging the bathroom for the bathtub. The dressing table was a killer too. The lights were very bright and you could easily put your makeup on without having to struggle on any shadows on your face. The table was very big too. Enough for you to place a laptop and yet have space to sprawl a meal on it.A slightly painful memory might be the day I arrived at the hotel when it was raining and I had to drag the luggage through the crowd to realise that I had to go behind Zara for the hotel entrance. And as the hotel lobby is located at the 21st floor, you will need to take a lift up and then go back down to your assigned room (if you are staying below 21st floor).The hotel room might be a bit tight but I didn't mind that much as the entire stay was truly perfect. A point to note. The lobby also provides T-Money topup services. So you can spare the trouble to meddle with the topup machines in the subway and approach the English-speaking staff at the front desk. Also, a special shoutout to the housekeeping staff. I had seen them struggling to clear the rooms during one of the peak days and they were really having a hard time to clear the back logs. Nonetheless, they still managed to keep the rooms extremely clean. Thank you to them, truthfully!","April 24, 2017","19    Solaria Nishitetsu Hotel Seoul Myeong-dong

Only issue was the extra charge to receive bedding for the sofa bed in the room. They treat it as an extra rollaway bed, which was a surprise considering Fraser place being an international company and I have never seen this type of charge in any other hotel which has a sofa bed already in the room. My advice, bring a sheet and blanket to avoid the $35+ /night to use the in room sofa bed. Fraser should re-evaluate this policy.

1118,"Stayed in this hotel with my wife and my 1 year old daughter. This is our first time travelling with our daughter and also our first time staying in a hotel with her. In my opinion, this hotel has the best location as it is situated away from the more touristy area, away from the busy streets and sea of tourist. From the airport, you can take the airport limousine bus and alight right at the doorstep of the hotel which is very convenient. Going to the airport was just as easy, just board the same airport limousine bus across the street. Going from the hotel to other touristy area like myeongdong, dongdaemun, and gyeongbukgung palace were just a bus ride away and the bus stop are conviniently located 2 minutes walk from the hotel. For this trip, I've favoured public bus as my main mode of transportation, but if you prefer metro, the hotel is between 2 subway station which both is about 5 minutes walk away.There is a local food street right behind the hotel with many Korean restaurants where you can also find 24 hours convinient store as well as coffee shops around the vicinity. Traditional namdaemun market is just a 5 minutes walk away and there is 1 subway station located near the market.This hotel also have the best front desk service I've experienced ever. We arrived early about 10am and the hotel's policy for check-in was to start at 3pm. To our surprise, the front desk check us in without us even requesting for early check in. The room also have what we have requested when booking like high floor, non-smoking room, room with sofabed & baby crib. Then the front desk service staff (sorry I forgot her name) again amazes me as 1 night my daughter lost her teddy bear on our way back to the hotel, and since not all the Korean speaks & understand English, we sought help from the front desk. We just told her that we could have left the bear in a coffee shop or in the bus, she helped us to call the coffee shop but unfortunately the bear was not there. Then she helped to call the bus company and since the bus were still ferrying passengers, they could not search the bus either. But she promised that she will follow up with the bus company. Then the next morning, we got a note from her saying the bear is found in the bus. In the note, she have gave us clear directions in english to the lost and found center. Then when we were about to leave the hotel to the center, again we ask the front desk staff to write in Korean our intention to collect the teddy bear for us to show the staff of center. Then when we were at the center, the staff denied there is a teddy bear found and again we asked the bus company to call the front desk to clarify and it turn up that the she had asked the bus company to keep it somewhere else so that other will not able to take it. We are really grateful that our ordeal were handled by such a responsible hotel staff.Now, something not so great about the hotel. First, sound proofing wasn't the greatest as I could hear the busses honks during the morning rush hour traffic. I can also hear people using the gym above my room sometimes during the day. The rice cooker buttons, air conditioner and heater switches are all in korean and while there are English instructions for the heater and air conditioner, there is none for the rice cooker.","June 10, 2019","20    Fraser Place Namdaemun Seoul

1126,"We travelled to Seoul with a 9 month old baby, which was a big part in selecting this hotel because of the suite and kitchen option. Good:- great location! Namdaemun market is across the street, perfect for grabbing street food/night eats to eat in kitchen while baby sleeps. A lot of main sites within 20 min walking distance - metro access is close by, but the metro lines are not very well connected and not very stroller friendly so was often easier to walk. - large room with fully stocked kitchen (premier suite). Kitchen had utensils and pot/pan for home cooking. Sliding doors to close bedroom off when baby sleeps was nice. - lots of restaurant options behind the hotel- hotel staff spoke perfect English and easy to communicate Bad:- the shuttle service from Seoul station only runs at specific times (last one being at 5pm). This was not clear when I was planning my trip and made it quite inconvenient when we got to the station and told we had to cab to the hotel (which was an adventure in itself!)- the walls are very thin and you can hear your neighbors quite clearly...especially at 2 am and their kids are running around screaming waking up our baby- the bed is very hard and can feel the springs coming through...after a whole day of carrying baby in a baby carrier, my back really needed a break. Unfortunately the hard bed has made my back worse. - the shower door doesn’t seal properly so you end up with a small pool in the washroom after every shower (not a deal breaker but worth a mention)Overall great stay and great value. Some small inconveniences but I would say the good outweighs the bad IMO. ","April 18, 2019","20    Fraser Place Namdaemun Seoul

Checked into a suite with my father assuming I could use the sofa bed as it’s advertised online, but when I asked for bedding from the front desk, they said to “set up” the sofa bed with sheets and a blanket would coat an extra $45 a night. Outrageous. I will be buying my own sheet and blanket for that much rather than give them extra money for a ridiculous policy. ","April 17, 2019","20    Fraser Place Namdaemun Seoul

1129,"The rooms at this hotel are awesome - large suites with plenty of space. There’s a separate bedroom, combined living and dining area. The restaurant, however, has very strange policies. We went to have dinner there our last night at the hotel because they advertised several specials that looked good and were reasonably priced. When we ordered, we learned that the specials are not available unless everyone in our party (3 of us) ordered the same thing. We didn’t want the same thing and the prices provided were per person (we were not ordering a dinner for the table). In addition, my son was unable to order anything off the “tapas” menu because you couldn’t have tapas unless everyone at the table had tapas. These rules were not noted on the English language menu and there was no rhyme or reason for them.","April 12, 2019","20    Fraser Place Namdaemun Seoul

The breakfest exceeded our expectations (do not miss an aloe juice - a great crescendo in the morning). The personnel was very helpful and attentive (special thanks to Ms.Esther Kim from the reception who recommended to us an experience with local Korean BBQ - a fun and a pleasure in one place).

I am in my fourties (and not super-old-fashioned) but I find it extremley irrtiating when guests appear in their sleeping wear or naked feed and hotel slippers in public space.

We had a high room which would have had a view of the nearby Gate if not for a billboard - but we did have a nice city view including N Seoul Tower. There was some traffic noise at night - but this we were on the front side of the hotel facing the road. We tried out the suana/baths, which was nice - the men's has an open-air heated pool (no view sadly).Everything you could want is a short (or mid-length) wander away - and for longer journeys within Seoul the public transport connections are excellent.

1166,"From the pre-booking, Aloft was very accomodating in ensuring I get connecting rooms before I prepay the rooms. I was travelling with my husband and 2 children aged 10 and 5. We were very comfortable in 2 Aloft Rooms. One had a king sized bed and one with 2 single beds. There is no way we will fit in one room because they will not allow a rollaway bed. They can set up a tent/kid's bed on the floor but that will leave us with no room for our 2 luggages. One of our rooms was an Accessible room so we didnt like to take a shower there so we all took a bath from the other bathroom but at least we had an extra toilet so we are more efficient in preparing every morning. We had comfortable sleep because the bed was firm enough and we love the pillows. The temperature in the room was also perfect. We also love the toiletries and enough shelves, hangers and space for all our luggage and things. The elevators can accomodate all occupants and we never waited a long time for an elevator to arrive.Checkin was a breeze. I requested to have our rooms ready on the wee hours since we got a room even if we were arriving the next day. They kept our room until we arrive as planned.Location is superb. Quiet enough to rest and near enough to get to the Myeongdong Shopping streets. We wouldnt want to stay in the hotels right in the middle of the busy area because it will be too noisy.Only drawback is there is no view. We got the back view with not so nice view but it wasnt so important to us. We just opened the curtains when we wanted to check if it was sunny/cloudy.Our stay was more than perfect. From the helpful concierge (especially Gina being our favorite), to the friendly front desk, to the very accomodating chefs making our eggs at the Nook restaurant. The hotel has all that we could ask for. The weighing scale at the lobby is also a good addition. We admire hotels who think of this.","June 20, 2019","21    Aloft Seoul Myeongdong

1167,"The rooms and the hotel overall fall a bit short of a 4star and really are more like a 3start rating. The rooms a decent size but they are noisy (both street noise and noise from the other rooms) and they had no view at all. The fixtures are also very average and the toiletries were bad quality. The cleaning was also VERY inconvenient...for example, one day we had no toiletries replaced even though we used up most and the next day we had even extra.What made me give them an extra star though was the excellent service everywhere (the check-in desk, the concierge, and the rooftop staff), the amazing location (close to the subway lines and walking distance to all palaces, to the hanok villages, and to the Namsan park). Also, they had a coin laundry on the third floor which was an amazing find and saved us one house chore back home. ","June 2, 2019","21    Aloft Seoul Myeongdong

1169,"I stayed here 5 nights. Amy upgraded me to a beautiful Breezy Suite on the 17th floor. It was AMAZING! They placed a lovely assortment of Korean snacks in my suite. Check in was a bit bumpy when I arrived at 8am on Saturday, May 25th. I didn’t expect my room to be ready this early, but I did expect superior customer service, or at least a friendly greeting. The young lady on the 2nd floor front desk couldn’t be bothered to say “good morning” or “welcome”. Instead, She kept her head down acting as if she was busy on the computer the entire time I was standing there. This really irritated me. Mind you I was completely exhausted from a 13 1/2 hour flight from the US and would have loved a warm greeting. Sadly, this is not what I received. I am immediately started to regret my decision to stay here. They took my credit card, information from my passport, and made me sign voluminous documents even though I wasn’t able to check into my room. I asked if they could at least keep my luggage until I could get into the room. They allowed me to do so. There was no recommendation for a place to sit down and have a coffee or breakfast while I waited for my room. I asked about an approximate wait time for the room to be ready. They were not able to assist. I walked around from 8 AM until 4 PM until well beyond Check-in time. At that point, I was irritable and super exhausted. When I arrived at the front desk there was a long line of people waiting to be checked in. This did not make me a happy camper as I had already checked in and only needed a key. Needless to say, I was asked to wait in the long line of people. Thankfully, that was the last of the bad impression which was left on me about this hotel. Everything else was uphill from here. The best thing about this hotel is the housekeeping staff. I had the absolute best housekeeping attended. Each and every day she went over and beyond to service my room and leave me more than enough goodies to make my stay comfortable. She greeted me with a warm and genuine smile and hello each and every day. I was actually very sad to leave such a warm personality. The assistant front desk manager “Elle” introduced herself to me the night before my departure. She was extremely kind to ask me if I had the opportunity to indulge in the Korean snacks that they left in my room. I explained that I loved the soup. She immediately went out of her way to stock my room with more Korean snacks. This truly warmed my heart. Not only did they restock my room with more Korean snacks, they also left me a Korean face-mask and beautiful hand cloth with Aloft Myeongdong engraved on it. This touched me in such a special way. I am already making plans to come back due to the excellent service.","May 29, 2019","21    Aloft Seoul Myeongdong

1174,"While the property claims to be an ALOFT hotel, it is anything but an Aloft. I have stayed in dozens of Aloft across the world, but this one is quite different. It doesnt have the ‘Spartan-Style’ element of Aloft hotels but attempts to add some elements. The room layout and fittings aer different, The Bathroom amenities are not from BLISS, the mini-bar treat are not there, etc. IT is more of a Asian feel hotel than a Aloft style. But still at the price we paid and the location it is a great value for money.LOCATION: Excellent location near all the action of the Myeongdong neighborhood.DINE + DRINK: They have a bar and restaurant on the 2nd floor. Not too chic, but funky enough for a drink or a quick mealROOM: We stayed in 2006, so this review is based on that; VIEW: lovely view of the mountains and the cityscape ; SIZE: Very spacious room; AIR-CON: Perfectly functioning cooler that helped in setting the perfect room temperature; BED: Comfortable bed that played the expected part to put me to sleep; BATHROOM: Stand in shower; TOILETRIES: Excellent spa quality cosmetics by BIGELOW brandFACILITIES: A Joke of a ‘Fitness center’ that is nothing more than a bigger room fitted with a few cardio machines. No free weights or any other equipment. No Swimming pool either!SERVICE: Friendly staff that took care of all my needs with a smile and made us feel pampered and well taken care of. HOW WIRED YOU WILL BE: Free high speed Wi-Fi that works well all over the property. Big Plasma TV screen dishing out dozens of channels spanning sports, news, music, movies and a wide variety of entertainment in multiple languages","May 4, 2019","21    Aloft Seoul Myeongdong

1175,"I had my first ever stay in a Aloft hotel – Aloft Myeongdong – just one night where I had a pleasant taste of a “next generation of hotel, using technology and design to enhance experiences”.Hotel location: I like the fact that this hotel is just next to the famous Myeongdong shopping district. It is also about 10 minutes’ walk to the Myeongdong subway/metro station (which I walked one morning to Exit 2 where the Funtastic Korea buses depart). There are a few ways to reach the hotel from Seoul Incheon Airport. One way is to take the KAL airport limousine bus 6701 (16,000 KRW one way) that stops opposite the hotel amongst several other stops. You then have to drag your luggage down the stairs into the underpass that's loated to the right of the bus stop and then up the stairs again. Upon exiting the underpass on the other side of the road, Aloft Myeongdong hotel is just to your right. You could also walk a few metres to the left of the bus stop and take the underpass that houses the Myeongdong Underground Shopping Centre. Another way is to take the taxi (about KRW 85,000 depending on traffic conditions) or private chauffeured services. As for going back to Seoul Incheon Airport, I purchased the KAL airport ticket from the hotel reception (who will give you the time table) and took the KAL airport limousine bus at 5:54am (bus was only quarter full) from the same bus stop opposite the hotel that drops passengers from the airport (journey took about 70 minutes). Alternatively, if you don’t want to drag the luggage down and up the underpass, you could also walk about 5 minutes to the Ibis Ambassador Seoul Myeongdong Hotel (same side of the road as Aloft Myeongdong) and then take the 6015 limousine bus to Incheon Airport (one way ticket costs KRW 15,000).Hotel staff: For me, the helpful and friendly staff really stands out. After I booked the hotel on the internet (as a SPG member), the Front Office staff (Rachel, Selina, Ann) promptly replied to all my queries on the transportation from the hotel to Incheon airport. On that check-in day, as I stepped into the arrival lobby on the ground floor in the early morning, I was greeted by a friendly lady staff who checked me into the system and placed my luggage bag in a secure area. When I came back after my tour in the evening, I went to the circular reception desk on the second level where another smiling and friendly lady English-speaking receptionist at the Front Office welcomed me and formally checked me into the hotel. She was also helpful in my purchase of the KAL limousine bus ticket from the hotel, the timetable for bus departure and the directions to take the bus.Hotel room: When I stepped into the modern Aloft Studio Room, I could see that everything is maintained so well (that it could be mistaken to be a new room even though the hotel opened in 2017) and very clean. While the bedroom is compact but the creamy white walls makes the room appear more spacious than it is. The bedroom comes with 2 single beds and the usual amenities - a wall-mounted LCD TV, safe, iron, ironing board, sandals, kettle, tea and coffee making facility etc. The bathroom does not have a bathtub but it has toiletries and a hair dryer that’s placed in a bag that’s marked “Hair Dryer”. I liked the colourful designs on the wall “painting”, the curtains, the carpet and the bolsters (yes, this is the first hotel that I stayed that has bolsters). I also enjoyed a good night’s sleep due to the comfortable bed and the good sound insulation from neighbouring rooms as well as from the Namdaemun Road that my room faces. The Wi-Fi speed is fast too. While the workstation desk, luggage storage platform and a sofa are all arranged in a straight row next to the floor-to-ceiling window, the size of the sofa and the workstation desk are too small. Hotel restaurant: As I have to catch at 5:54am KAL limousine bus next morning, I did not eat the breakfast at the Nook restaurant.Overall, I had a pleasant stay in this hotel with its excellent location and easy reach via bus from the Incheon airport. It now opens up another competitive choice to the IHG hotel that I usually stay when I visit cosmopolitan Seoul.","April 30, 2019","21    Aloft Seoul Myeongdong

1177,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Aloft Seoul Myeongdong. The location is premium. The Myeondong alley shopping and street food along with premium stores and restaurants are only about a 5 minute walk. The subway stop is even closer. The airport limo bus stop is also a convenient 5 minute walk. GIMPO to Myeongdong by airport limo bus is only 7k Won/person while Myeongdong to Incheon is only 15k Won/person. There were plenty of available seats to and from the hotel. Note that ICN terminal 1 is a long ride from ICN terminal 2. Don't be alarmed. Just make sure you know at which terminal you need to be.The hotel room is excellent. Before getting to the hotel, I tried to upgrade because I realized the square footage is smaller than our hotel in Kyoto and we thought that was tight. Aloft was fully booked so couldn't. I was pleasantly surprised that the room was well planned and provided more walk space than our Kyoto hotel, feedback I mentioned on my Kyoto hotel review. Aloft also has high ceilings. The room is well-appointed with light switches on both sides of the bed. The bed itself and pillows were nice and comfortable. The bathroom is modern with American Standard toilet and sink. The hotel provided nice toiletries. Staff was pleasant at the front desk who checked us in efficiently and helped me find a good spa for myself and my husband, at breakfast where we were accommodated an extra 30 minutes when we arrived just as breakfast was ending, and the concierge who helped us find a good BBQ restaurant on our first night in Seoul. Housekeeping competently cleaned our room and made our bed regardless of the time we left the room. The hotel has an electronic DO NOT DISTURB sign, which is convenient for housekeeping I imagine. They were also pleasant when we passed them on the hallway. There are only 2 elevators for 21 floors. I did not mind it because even when we waited sometimes, it didn't take that long. In addition, the elevators were programmed to apologize for the wait. That's a nice touch.","April 22, 2019","21    Aloft Seoul Myeongdong

1178,"The hotel is centrally located to all the shopping and food trips you can do in Myeongdong. The rooms are impeccably clean and spacious. Just a comment on the customer service though. Just two days ago, on a Friday afternoon I asked the receptionist for help in getting a taxi going to Gwanghwamun, since the Kakao Taxi app I downloaded couldn't find a taxi for me. The response of the receptionist was, if I couldn't find a taxi thru the Kakao Taxi app, she also couldn't find a taxi for me since she also use the same app and she suggested that I just walk. It is a very peculiar response which I didn't expect coming from the hotel, to not offer any assistance at all. Then I asked her about the feature in Kakao Taxi app which would require a local Korean number, if that might help in getting a taxi, and if she can help me with that, her response is the same and it seems that she is not willing to help at all. She suggested that I should just wait outside the hotel and flag a taxi... at that point it was getting to be on my nerves at how unhelpful she is. So I shrugged this off. The following day, I asked again about the fastest way to get to Gangnam and again, there was no good answer except that I should just call a taxi on my own. It is really quite surprising that the great hotel from Marriott would deliver such appalling service. It made me more than a little bit disapppointed considering that the hotel has such high standards in everything else. Would appreciate if the receptionists are better trained to handle similar concerns like mine and I'm sure there would be other guests who would need the same help.","April 20, 2019","21    Aloft Seoul Myeongdong

It was also stocked with CO Bigelow Apothecary products which we got to enjoy! The sheets and the pillows were pristine and the AC unit worked perfectly.Room Service, on the other hand, needed more selection of breakfast food.

The staff was so nice and super cute to draw the wording on the mirror. Really surprise us for the service. I hope that is not too late to send you guys the comment.

1190,Stayed several times with this property and definitely one of the best Aloft! Great platinum recognition and efficient FO staff. I think the management did something right. A few steps away from Myeongdong main shopping area and there is a gym on 3F (They should mention in the elevator if possible). Rooms are a bit small but bright and comfy.

From my last visit i thought i would never stay at Aloft again but Danny convinced me to give them a chance to redeem themselves, and he and his team far outdid themselves. From the airport till check out everything went smoothly, dare i say better than smooth it went perfectly.I thank Danny and Elle for helping me throughout my stay and making sure it was a perfect one.The staff have improved in experience dramatically since i first visited, when it had just opened, they were very helpful and always willing to help, the concierge was great at helping me getting to my meetings with various companies by writing the address in Korean as Taxi's find it much more convenient. The main reason i love this hotel same as last time is the location, you can't go wrong, there is shopping, street food, cosmetics, department stores everything you could want all within 5 min walk, taxis are easy to get as it is on a main street. You have two metros within 5-10 min walking distance. Thank you again Danny for everything and i will surely be visiting your property again for my next trip to Seoul.","January 27, 2019","21    Aloft Seoul Myeongdong

We checked in late on the first night and unfortunately encountered the system error that the rooms were fully booked. In less than 3 minutes the Aloft reception gave us a quick and satisfying solution, which helped us settled down in another hotel nearby shortly. It was rather amazing that the Aloft Assistant Front Office Manager, Elle,a nice lady, accompanied us all the way back to Aloft the next morning and expressed sincere apology for the inconvenience caused. We had encountered similar situations before but never had thought that the Aloft would be so concerned and would handle so well. No doubt that the rest of our tour was very much inspired. Not even need to mention the hotel facilities - well equipped, fully prepared for our needs and enables us to have lovely city views.What impressed us most was their excellent hotel service even though it was our first visit to this hotel, and sure enough that there will be more and more visits after because of the charming smiles and remarkable efforts depict from every Aloft staff.Five starts are definitely undeniable for the rewards of Aloft Meyongdong!","December 24, 2018","21    Aloft Seoul Myeongdong

Location is convenient to subway Euljiro 1 station, Myeongdong & airport shuttle bus stop. But need to wait for longer time for lift as there is only 2 lifts! so need to be patient, make sure u don't forget anything before step out room else waiting for another round of lift can test your patient...Didnt really feel the hospitality of hotel staffs, came back with shopping bags on both hands, but no one help open hotel door :( & where's the greetings? When checking on how to go to a place, staff print a small map with exit no. without further instruction on how to walk from station to the place.

So glad that I made Aloft Seoul Myeondong as my home for 5 days/4 nightsAs a Marriot/SPG Platinum Premier Elite with Ambassador status, I have stayed at numerous Marriott (SPG) brand hotels and am impressed with the high hospitality standard of this hotel. Aloft Myeondong is absolutely a fabulous hotel and well beyond my expectation.Excellent location for visiting Myeongdong area and Seoul. Walking distance to EVERYThing you want to eat/buy/experience.Conveniently located next to major subway lines, I use it as a base for day trip around Seoul.Starting from arriving at the lobby - Helpful bell desk and front desk. Smooth check in process by Daniel and greeted by Elle Minhee personally. I had a room at high floor overseeing beautiful Xmas lighting from across. Luckily, I got offer an upgrade to a bigger suite starting on my 3rd day. Not ideal moving room in between my stay but hey, it’s an upgrade to suite! Excellent housekeeping staff: keep my room fresh and tidy every day!Restaurant wait staffs: all helpful and friendly. And also the cook makes good noodle and eggs!Tip: Be patient with elevators during peak hours, there could be a short wait :) there’s another elevator going just between lobby, concierge floor/road exit and restaurant. Use it accordingly.Tip: Breakfast: Try it! Good Varieties from pastries, hot food items, made to order omelets/eggs and even noodle soup! And don’t forget fruits (sweetest grape and kiwi!), juices and coffee/cappuccino. it's that good.Tip: Convenience Store around the corner and a Starbucks, not my cup of 'tea' but wife wants a Soy Milk Latte every morning so that’s perfect location. Most important Tip: Chat with Concierge! Do yourself a favor, ask for local good eats restaurants, shopping spots, anything you want to know about Seoul.

1210,"We stayed in a Breezy Suite on our visit to Seoul during 19-24 October. The suite was very new, clean, spacious and had a separate living room which was nice. It even had a walk-in closet that was sizable enough for us to easily keep our two luggages and two carry-on bags. The bed was very comfortable and the pillows were just perfect for my liking. The bathroom was spacious and the towels were nice and thick. We booked a bed and breakfast package, and were not disappointed with the quality of the food. Although not as many selections as you would find in a typical hotel breakfast buffet, it was good enough for us. The biggest downside was that this hotel did not have bell services, so you had to carry your own bags up to your room. It would be fine if you do not have too many suitcases, but could be a problem for guests with many bags or for the elders who many not be fit enough to carry their own bags. Another downside was that the bedroom glass windows were very thin, meaning you could hear very clearly the sound of cars and activities outside the hotel. I had some trouble sleeping on some nights due to this noise. If you are sensitive to this or are a difficult sleeper, beware. Location was hard to beat, literally five minutes from the main shopping street in Myeongdong. Overall we had a good stay and would rate this hotel as good value for money.

As a platinum member, we got free breakfast which was good. The breakfast was probably not as fancy as other bigger hotels, but there were plenty of food.The room was new. The best was the location very close to the night market but not too close to get bothered by the crowd.There is an airport bus with a stop across the street from the hotel which is convenient. The bus driver is really on time on every stop. If the bus is early, the bus driver will still wait until the time to leave. Sometimes each stops waiting time is quite long though.

The spa is 5 star as the staff physically and mentally take you on a journey to wellbeing bliss. Lots of spa ceremony which i love. Recommend using the Sauna facilities seperate to the Spa. The plunge pull is a brave but worthwhile choice. And you must experinece the traditional Korean scrub with no pomp or ceremony you leave fully scrubbed revitilised. As a vegan i worried about Seoul but the extensive buffet options made it easier to eat meat-free. Much Korean food is veg-based.

1236,"The renovation of the rooms at Grand Hyatt Seoul has been quite well done. Structure of the great former interior design has been kept, and new additions make the room comfortable and good looking. The biggest improvement is the bathroom which looks now very elegant and open, though being small for a hotel of that category. Food at the Club Lounge was very nice ; not a huge choice, but all of good quality. For many clients the main frustration would come from the pool and the sauna. If the pool looks great, there are far not enough sun beds around it for a hotel that big. The reason is that a big business is done with the pool restaurant, and tables are preferred to sun beds for the clients. It's very early 6pm closing time confirms it. During summer the rule is that you can access the pool only once during your all stay ; that's insane and will prevent me to book again during that period. But again it's understandable considering that restaurant seems a priority there. Last noticeable thing is that the access at the sauna is charged if you're not booked into a Club room ; this is totally unfair. So the hotel is very peasant and comfortable, but some rules might prevent me to book there again. ","June 2, 2019","22    Grand Hyatt Seoul Hotel

1237,"We were staying one night in a executive suite on the last (20th) floor. The room itself and the Namsan Tower view are absolutely great.However, I did not bring my mobile phone with me and my battery was like 5% in the morning so I called guest service and asked if they can borrow me a charger. They said they are unable to borrow it (seriously?...) but can only sell it to me for 15$. I said yes. After further 10-15min. of waiting, I was told all chargers are sold out. So the only option is to bring it to concierge desk for charging. That was really bad option because at this moment I was waiting for a very important call. It was kind of unpleasant and strange experience, one would expect to get a phone charger at the 5-star hotel after paying nearly 600$ for a room. Also, there are a lot of small but kinda annoying hidden charges in the bill making around 100$ in total (service surcharge, VAT, service surcharge on room upgrade, VAT on the service surcharge on the room upgrade and also 10$ for parking fee). Come on, are you serious to charge me 10$ for parking after spending 600$ for the room, food and drinks? Not that it hurts my wallet, but it looks pretty stingy and ungenerous for a such plush hotel.The rest of experience was very good and I will definetely come back again.","May 26, 2019","22    Grand Hyatt Seoul Hotel

1256,"Grand Hyatt Seoul is currently undegoing a renovation (which was written very small when you book the hotel). We got to the hotel in the morning after a red-eye flight and was given a room around midday. We tried to sleep but of course because of the renovation it was a hard thing to do. The room also got really hot so we asked about the AC and heating system -- we ended up getting a fan in the room. When you are staying in a hotel room, you obviously use the toilet. In this case, our toilet was not working properly (the hotel toilet has different feautires like in Japan). Because this was our holiday and we wanted everything to be nice (or at least functioning), we reluctantly called front desk and asked if they could fix it. The next morning, we were offered a different room because we booked the room for 3 nights. We gladly accepted the offer since it was a bigger room, everything seemed to be working and it was slightly away from the floors that are going through renovation. We then unpacked again and left to explore Seoul. The next morning, we went out again to see the temples. After a long and tiring day of doing all the touristy things, we came back to the hotel trying to rest but the room was not cleaned. We called and asked why. They said they thought we checked out already. We were then offered some free beverages at their club lounge when the room is being cleaned, but we refused the offer because we just needed to rest and be in the room for the night.Overall, this was quite an unpleasant stay with a 5 star hotel.

We stayed in a connecting room with my Daughter for 5 nights. Room side is just nice, is clean and the plus point is they provide free mini bar with beers and drinking water and it is refilled Everyday. The staff are Super polite and helpful especially when we approached them for directions to our destinations. The only improvement is that they could consider change the curtain access to the toilet and showers to a glass door or wooden door in the connecting room with twin beds. As we need to open and close the curtains to the toilet countless time each day it would be much more hygienic if it is a glass or wooden door so the handle can be cleaned.

We would have preferred connecting rooms when traveling with kids, but ok, we managed. The breakfast restaurant was ok, but not fabulous and the messy desk at the entrance doesn't fit the hotel and the style. However, the service and attention from the staff were excellent all week. Even the restaurant tips were exotic and different (e.g., the raw grab place in Gangnam was an experience itself).

The only thing was that because the hotel is relatively new, not many taxi drivers were aware of it and we had some difficulties trying to guide the driver to the hotel.

1295,"I had a very pleasant experience when I stayed in the hotel during my first trip to Seoul in April 2018. And when I started planning my trip this year, I didn’t even bothered to compare other hotels in the area. First of all, I have to comment on the speedy response of the hotel to emails. I made a mistake by booking a double bed during reservation. As I am traveling with my 79 years old dad and being a light sleeper myself, sharing bed will means a week of sleepless nights for me. As I made my reservation through Agoda, I am not able to cancel or rebook and Agoda is not helpful at all. I wrote to the hotel with my request to change the room type and received a response within the day. Upon arrival at the hotel, I noticed they have more staff now compared to the same time last year. But they have maintained the high standard in all of them. Everyone could speak fluent english and were really helpful when you need them. The check-in was fast and efficient. Everything in the room looks exactly the same. The mini bar is well-stocked with beers, coke and drinking water all the time. And the beds were really comfortable. Unlike other hotels, they seem to have a fixed schedule for housekeeping. As we left early in the morning and had pressed the button for ‘make up room service’, we would think our room should be made in the morning. We were taken by surprise when we returned to a messy room at 2.30pm. Subsequently, we noticed our room will only be made at 3pm everyday. This is not a big issue as we can also chill comfortably at the cozy lobby. Overall, we had a good stay. We will return to this hotel if we are in Seoul again.

1297,"A small hotel themed on making Movies, the location of this hotel is superb, although it can be a little difficult to find on the first visit. Once there though it proves to be at the centre of where you’ll likely want to be in Seoul. The rooms are compact but very clean and well appointed. The bathrooms are especially good with a fabulous surprise for westerners unacquainted with certain luxury washroom fittings in the Far East as well! Be slightly mindful that rooms overlooking the street can be a bit noisy until around midnight due to the hubbub of diners outside the multiple restaurants opposite. But probably the key attribute that makes the place so good is the attitude of the staff. Every single person we interacted with - and there were many - was friendly and helpful in a genuine way. I especially commend the breakfast crew who were wonderful. Our family interaction with them was as good as it could be - rather special. I loved their honest displays of real personality which enabled connection in a friendly and down to earth way, always underpinned by a desire to get things spot on for guests. It’s a good value small hotel run at a personable yet accomplished level. If you don’t really want the aloofness of a 5 Star joint, this is a very good substitute.

1311,"Hotel 28 is a clean and safe hotel. It's located in the heart of Myeongdong which means you could go eat, bar hop, or visit other touristy denstiions in Seoul while being in the center of it all. The interior bathroom is clean and there's a small gym inside as well. Service was great as well. The only down part is that you have to walk to this hotel from the train station; as the streets are packed with people and cars can't really reach the hotel.","March 20, 2019","23    Hotel28 Myeongdong

1313,"Stayed here for 4 nights, couldn't wait to review Hotel 28 Myeongdong because it deserves to be discovered and appreciated by more potential visitors. Our plan in Seoul was to visit as many local restaurants as possible, and since unfortunately many of them do not support online reservation, we need Korean speakers to give them phone calls. The reservation process was back and forth with more than 10 emails, but the front desk staff were very patient and friendly all the way, can't be more grateful.Their staff were helpful during our whole stay, and I would say they're one of the most precious assets of the hotel. You can tell they have a great atmosphere among themselves, which delivers a positive vibe to visitors. Room was great, service was great, location was great can't be better. Highly recommended if you're looking for a place to stay near Myeongdong.","March 10, 2019","23    Hotel28 Myeongdong

1316,My partner and I stayed in hotel 28 for three nights. I have to say it’s one of the best experiences so far. What’s the best about this hotel is the people. They are passionate and happy. It’s not uncommon to meet professional staffs but uncommon to meet professional staffs who truly enjoy their work. Great service from the staffs! Thank you! It happened that it was my birthday during the stay and they got me this birthday surprise! Everything has been exceeding my expectation. Ah they can communicate in English well which is even better! The other thing that we like about the hotel is the bathroom- the toilet bowl is warm and the shower is gentle and comfy. Their toiletries are organic products. Can tell the owner and the team are thinking from the customer’s perspective. Their complimentary mini bar is very good too! There’s beer which is perfect for fried chicken at night.

1332,"The best thing about Tmark Hotel is that it's close yet far from the bustling Myeongdong shopping area, which means that you can seek reprieve from the chaos in the quiet area that surrounds the hotel. And yes, that means that you can choose to walk to the hotel from Myeongdong (I highly recommend exiting past the Royal Hotel; it's much closer) if you enjoy the exercise. If not, the nearest metro station, Chungmuro, is only a stop away from Myeongdong itself.As for the hotel itself, it has all the basic facilities you'll need and, really, if you're in Seoul, you'll be too busy exploring outside of the hotel so there really isn't much to say. The beds, however, were very comfortable and not annoyingly soft like other hotels I've been to. I also liked that you're able to open the small windows for ventilation during the winter and that there's a semi-auto repellent screen to keep any pesky insects away.My only gripe is that the washrooms were very small. Or rather, the addition of the bathtub to the tiny bathroom makes it seem cramped. If the hotel plans to undergo any renovations, I suggest that they remove the bathtubs and have showers-only for their smaller toilets — it will also help with the puddles of water that form on the ground and not risk any damages to the electric toilet.","January 28, 2019","24    Tmark Hotel Myeongdong

We were chatting and going about our night when a lady runs from the hotel to right across from us and vomited all over the floor. I get it, its normal, you drink, you get drunk sure... Until I realized she works at the front desk of the tmark hotel. A man came out afterwards to aid her but ended up arguing with the owner of the fried chicken joint. The owner asked him to clean up her vomit as it interferes with his business, its considerate as we don't want to have to see or smell that. It's gross. After arguing awhile, 2 more ladies came out from the hotel to separate the 2 that are arguing. Finally they left and the man came back to pick up the vomit (good for him). I just find it troublesome that they represented the hotel and to be drinking in the hotel then come out to vomit. Lol. They could've went elsewhere to drink or don't. It's unprofessional. We also had a leaky sink that was never fixed. They were unhelpful when we asked her to ask our driver how long he was going to be as we needed to leave to the airport.

It catered more for the Koreans than people like us. Restaurant did not allow signing for the meals & drinks , asking for spot payment. Cannot quarrel with their policy but I would certainly prefer being billed to be cleared at the time of checking out.I must repeat that staff at the reception was warm & friendly.

Dirty sheets, smelly shower curtain (which 4 star hotel still uses them), air condition not working, no water re-fill station like the other hotel, rooms not as new. Considering these hotels are not far from each other I would not opt for TMark.","June 17, 2018","24    Tmark Hotel Myeongdong

Room is clean and they provide water, coffee and teabags in the room.The only downside which is quite important to us was the wifi speed. It is really slow considering how fast wifi is in Korea. It is even slower than my wifi back at home. Hopefully they can improve that.The air con / heater is also uncontrollable in the room so it can get stuffy and bit annoying sometimes not being able to control room temperature to your own wish. I got a namsan tower view which was very nice.","May 30, 2018","24    Tmark Hotel Myeongdong

1352,"Hotel is 3min away from Chungmuro station and a 15-20min walk away from the Myeongdong Shopping Street. Convenience stores and restaurants surrounds the hotel as well! Airport Bus station is 5min away however, the driver did not announce the specific stop hence, many of the passengers on board were brought to the last station at Myeongdong Street where we had to find our way to the specific hotel.Booked a Deluxe Twin Room for our stay in November. Room was really cozy and kept us warm such that we did not want to leave as the weather outside was too cold for comfort. Bathroom came with a bathtub, showerhead and heated toilet seat. I must say I loved the toiletries provided by the hotel especially the shampoo (Can you tell me if this could be bought anywhere?) as they smell so good and kept my hair really soft without the need of using the conditioner! We opt to go greener and thus, only requested for room to be made up. Housekeeping was really nice to hang up clothes we left on the chairs and even folded our jacket/sweater nicely and place it on the bed. Bottled water were refilled everyday as well! Overall, it was a worthwhile 5night stay at the hotel which was less than $100/night! Will definitely come back to Tmark the next time i am back!","May 7, 2018","24    Tmark Hotel Myeongdong

Imagine as receptionist how many people she have to meet daily however she could remember my name & greet me. I am impressed. As a foreigner, it feel good when u are greet by your name in overseas. With her smile even make me feel like home. ^^After the check-in procedure, the room was another thing that impressed me. The room was clean with modern washroom. All toiletries are provided.The only 'feedback' I have is they don't provide any room service. As I was fall sick quite badly, I couldn't wake up to go to the restaurant. When I call to front-desk they told me they don't have room service. Hence, I need to order food delivery from outside and because of security purpose they don't allow the delivery boy to send the food to my room and I have to walk down.

1367,"Me and my wife stayed at TMark Hotel Myeongdong for about a week in early December 2017. Overall we had a very good stay. The location of the hotel is probably the strongest point. It is located literally just steps from the Chungmuro subway station which provides easy access to the remainder of the city via subway. The hotel is also a 10-minute walk from the busy Myeongdong shopping street. It's far away enough so that your hotel stay is quiet, but close enough that it's a comfortable stroll to reach there. However, there's lots of little restaurants within the vicinity of the hotel if you're looking for a more quieter eating experience. Great coffees and cafes nearby! In the end, I only gave the hotel a 4-star rating because there was nothing really exceptional or any services provided that went beyond the call-of-duty. In fact, other than check-in and check-out, I don't think we interacted with the hotel staff. They kept our room clean everyday, and I suppose that's all that we could ask for. It was a very good stay, and it would be an easy recommend.","December 18, 2017","24    Tmark Hotel Myeongdong

I picked the Makers based on location and the look of the hotel online.On arrival the lobby/reception area was kind of funky with the feel of an industrial apartment like you find in many parts of the world.Check in was speedy and friendly and soon enough I was off to my room.Rooms are smallish if you’re used to Australian or American hotels, but on par with lots of what you’d find in London. The great part though is that they’re super well laid out so you won’t feel cramped at all. The one thing I would have like was a bit more hanging space for clothing.After settling in I headed back to reception where I was given a bunch of info about both the hotel and things I might like to see and do nearby - awesome and super helpful info - be sure to check out the book in the lobby which has cool places and all sorts of info.Finally, a special thanks to Sally!

There is both upward and downward escalator at this exit. There are escalators all the way through so I didnt have difficulty managing my 17kg luggage. If going to Seoul station, reception will recommend exit 3. There is no escalator at this exit. The one with lift is at exit 7, which is just across the street. The area has a number of food places and tent food stall that open till late. So may be noisy for some people. Drivers in Seoul like to honk. The location is on a small street so this wasn't a problem.","April 13, 2019","25    Makers Hotel

The hotel is also within walking distance from Myeongdong shopping street. It is really accessible to go anywhere from the hotel and very convenient to get back to the hotel as you won't have to walk much after exiting the metro station because the hotel is literally right beside the station. They also had great service. The hotel staffs are really warm, kind and friendly. They greeted me and my family everytime they saw us and tended to anything we needed. The rooms were also really cozy and clean and there are convenience stores, eateries and restaurants around the hotel. Overall, a really great hotel and a great experience!

1390,"All was ok until we had a Very bad experience checking out. We had to also pay a deposit that upon checking in which is not informed until you reach the hotel. On the last day when we checked out, we left our baggage at the hotel lobby and went for a short day out before heading back to collect them and head to the airport. The hotel staff then told us that we were smoking in the room as the room smelt of smoke. The both of us do not smoke at all and was shocked of this accusation. We asked to inspect the room and also for evidence like cigarette buds whick they may have found of which they were quick to respond that the room had been cleaned and a candle was lit to remove the smell. Clearly, they could not produce evidence and was on the defensive the moment we asked for them. Funny thing was they could have informed us while we were outside and clarified with us upon finding out but they chose to do it upon us coming back and were rushing for the airport. We left very angrily and will continue to monitor the credit card charges in case there are any fraudulany charges made or that the refund of the deposit do not happen. We are unsure if this is a scam. So beware.","March 9, 2019","25    Makers Hotel

The entrance to the subway is right at it's doorstep, and it's possible to walk all the way to Myeongdong and the Dongdaemun area, though I would recommend taking the subway or bus.

The living area also has a nice sitting space with storage cabinets and a small safe. Everything seems very new and well-maintained. It wouldn't hurt if they could include some luggage racks in the rooms.The breakfast is rather basic, though sufficient, if you're looking to have an early start to the day and hit all the major tourist attractions once they open. This is provided for at their cafe, The Common, which also hosts occasional events there was a jazz quartet playing while we were there.Staff are generally very helpful and polite, though fluency in English varies.

1395,"The hotel reception is decorated as if it’s a hipster coffee shop in Shoreditch rather than a hotel in Seoul. A lot of effort has obviously gone into the very fashionable design of the hotel. The location is perfect - right next to a subway entrance. The subways are easy to use and very inexpensive. Lots of food venues on your doorstep including the very fashionable old part of Insa-dong opposite. However, if you want better food at at much more reasonable price, turn left out of the hotel and walk under the tunnel to the new part of India-dong. Great shopping as well there. The rooms are small, but perfectly adequate. The hotel, like the rest of Seoul is immaculately clean. Reception staff are very helpful. The beds are very hard. The room was a bit style over substance. Instead of having seating, bizarrely with a tv behind it, more storage would have been preferable. A few shelves and a half wardrobe with four coat hangers is not adequate for two adults on a ten night stay.","October 31, 2018","25    Makers Hotel

1398,"I came across Makers Hotel on a hotel booking website while planning our trip to Seoul. Initially I was hesitant to stay in the ""tourist area"", since I imagined something like Khao San Road in Bangkok. The price was also very reasonable -- and inclusive of breakfast -- which made me wonder if it was too good to be true. But the photos looked great, the website looked great, and the reviews were good, so I booked. NO REGRETS!!! We stepped into the lobby late in the evening, and the look and smell of the place were perfectly charming and restful and took away the exhaustion of the trip there*. Mike who checked us in was very friendly and efficient, and was patient with our questions. The room was small and simple but thoughtful and comfortable, with a nice work desk, a firm bed, a bench for sitting and placing luggage, a safe, slippers and robes, and lots of storage space in the closet. The bathroom is modern and very functional, and the toiletries smell GREAT. And everything is insanely CLEAN.But our favorite thing by far was the breakfast. We had expected a crowded, chaotic, bare-bones kind of setup -- too many stays at the Hampton Inn! -- but instead we entered a dining room that was beautifully designed, so clean, and had jazz music playing. What a great way to start the day. The food was wonderful too -- cereal, Korean rice, ham and cheese, breads, coffee, soup, salad, and more. Thank you Makers Hotel, we will definitely stay with you again when we're next in Seoul!*One word of warning: if you're taking the Airport Express train, be sure to get on the 5 Line to get to station Exit 4. We got on the 1 Line and got to Exit 3, since that's what Googlemaps and Naver Maps told us to do. We ended up lugging our luggage through REALLY long, winding subway passages, sometimes up and down stairs since there were no options for elevators or escalators. And it's a longer walk from Exit 3 to the hotel too. Good thing the lobby was such a welcome sight -- took the exhaustion and crankiness away instantly!","August 14, 2018","25    Makers Hotel

It is a walking distance to Samjigil-street for viewing some stores and a much longer walk to Gyeongbokgung palace (easily reachable through subway). The hotel itself looks neat and has AC in all rooms.The semi-double room is small but works well for 2 people. Sleeping however can be a problem; personally I cannot stand much noise when I sleep, and considering the location the nights were rather loud. Earplugs were my friends!I never spent much time at the hotel because of plans so I cannot comment the food or services.

1405,"My wife and I spent nine nights in the Makers Hotel. The staff was friendly and helpful. Most of them greeted us warmly each time the saw us enter or leave the hotel. They gave good advice on things such as using the metro and getting a bus to the airport. For us the best aspect of the hotel was it’s location in the heart of the historic center of Seoul. There is a lot to see in the city and from the hotel it was a short walk to the World Heritage palaces and most of the other important sites of Seoul. Another big plus was that all of the staff spoke English well. The rooms were rather small but neat, modern, and well appointed. Our nine day stay was separated into three separate bookings. For one of the bookings we were put in a substandard room with some concrete walls, a tiny window, and an electric socket with wires exposed. We were quite disappointed, especially my wife, who is claustrophobic. We asked for another room but had to endure the small one for two nights because the hotel was full. I think it was inappropriate to offer such an ugly room in a hotel with such a good reputation. I recommend that anyone staying here be sure to request a room with a normal size window and painted walls. The breakfast was nothing special with a minimum of selections available, but you could get a healthy and filling meal if you chose the right items. The breakfast was also exactly the same every morning. This wouldn’t matter to someone staying one or two nights but for our nine-day stay it proved to be rather boring. I recommend the Makers Hotel as a friendly, reasonably priced hotel in an expensive city.","June 4, 2018","25    Makers Hotel

Our room had no views (to a wall) and was not decorated, so was very cold. The double rooms we saw were much better. More cozy, well decorated and warm.

Thanks to TripAdvisor, we were ready for the masculine decor and emphasis on innovation.Loved the lobby, breakfast lounge, and bathroom, but the room lacked any sense of coziness. I wish that there was a comfortable couch in the living room suite, that invited one to sit casually vs. in a stilted way. A couple of art pieces would also have warmed up the walls.The bedroom was much improved when they responded to our request for a pillow top mattress. Their options are limited, but it made a world of difference to have a softer sleep. Thankfully, the room was quite quiet, so we were fortunate to feel like we were in a private space away from the energy of the city.Beyond a few discomforts, we felt right at home and loved our ability to head out on our treks and return to such a great neighborhood.

1412,"Makers Hotel is the ideal sweet spot of a hotel that is difficult to find - it's a budget accommodation that does a good job of making itself look like it isn't. And I mean that in a good way.Makers lobby is cozy and stylish, like your cool uncle's cigar den. Hallways continue the theme with dark finishes and accent lighting. Once you're inside the room the flash and bang disappear and you're inside a very basic hotel room that is just enough to get the job done. I'm a fan, especially with hotel prices in Seoul being so outrageous in many cases.The bed is a bit on the hard side, but that's pretty common in Asia. Not a ton of space in the room but you're better off spending your time enjoying street food or exploring the various neighborhoods in one of Asia's most dynamic cities, so who needs room in the hotel? Shower had great pressure and constant hot water. Again - pretty bare bones but still not a hostel. The hotel's location is close to many sights you'd want to see, tons of great food nearby, and a short walking distance to many of Seoul's biggest attractions and shopping destinations.

At the Sinpo Market(신포국제시장) in Chinatown, our great Korean food adventure took off to a good start: tasting the famous dakgangjeong 닥강정 (deep fried crispy chicken glazed in spicy, sticky, and sweet sauce). For eight nights (7-14 March 2018), we stayed at the tenth floor (top) floor, overlooking a Hanok village. It was quiet, so that we could sleep well. For the buffet breakfast, Makers Hotel varies its soup, providing soup of the day (corn, potato, carrot etc.), so it's not boring. Besides, it puts healthy food on the table: salad, fruits, egg and yogurt. Makers Hotel has satisfied my key need: location, location, location!

1422,"My husband and I came from Norway, and met up with my mother in Seoul. She found Makers online, and our choice to stay here had a big influence on the experience of the weekend!! We stayed in one of the three person rooms, which wasn't very large but not too small and had everything we needed.... including a cute welcome package with some treats! We really liked that we were provided with bathrobes and slippers, as well as the fridge,kettle and tea in the room for the mornings. We did not have breakfast at the hotel during our stay, but we visited The Common for coffees and it was very cozy. Our weekend was made extra special by the fantastic service we received from the hotel staff. I must make special mention of Mike - he went above and beyond to help us with any questions we had, ordering taxi services for us, and giving excellent recommendations of the neighborhood. He made us feel so welcome, taken care of, and his service was more attentive than the concierge service at 5 star hotels!The hotel is located directly across the street from the Bukchon Hanok village, which is an excellent place to spend your afternoon wandering around. If you are looking for directions, just ask the front desk and they will print a map of the area and show you exactly where to go!We were in search of dinner relatively late one night, and Mike sent us across the street to a tiny restaurant which is popular with locals and loved by bloggers - the food was fantastic and we never would have known about it if not for the suggestion. The metro stations is literally ten paces from the hotel door, which is incredibly convenient.We loved our weekend at Makers and will definitely be staying here again in the future.","February 12, 2018","25    Makers Hotel

So much detail to everything even the lift!Location wise, it's directly in front of Jongno-3-ga station, exit 4 (connects to line 5). It's convenient enough since Jongno-3-ga is a transfer station for 3 different lines (line 1, 3 and 5). There's a CU convenience store right opposite the hotel and loads of eateries (some 24hrs ones) around the hotel too!The only downside is, the escalator to the station from exit 4 is very narrow (only fits 1 person) (but that's not the hotel's fault) so be mindful if you're carrying big luggages! Also, there are stairs leading to the train platform (no lift or escalators at one point)!However not to worry as there's a direct bus (6002) to incheon airport and it's only a 3min walk! 10,000won and it comes every 10-15min!The room is spacious enough and very clean! There were only 5 rooms on my floor which makes it less noisy :) toilet was clean too and toiletries were provided :)I want to commend the exceptional service provided by the staff! All the staff at the reception are well versed in English and are extremely friendly!On my first night, I discovered that my toilet was choked at 12.30am (the reception closes at 1am) and I was panicking. (I might have used too much toilet paper previously lol) anyway the staff on duty that night came up to my room to help me unclog the toilet bowl and when he returned with a new floor mat for me, he even prepared a little packet of snacks for me!!!!! So thoughtful and sweet! This little gesture was enough to give this hotel a 11/10 rating!!!!Price is extremely affordable and reasonable as well! Definitely will return and stay here again if I come back to Seoul!

1432,"Another hotel that I would like to recommend in Seoul. The Makers hotel was situated just next to subway from Jongno 3 ga, Exit 4. From here, you can easily access to Insadong, Myeong-dong area etc. There are lots of restaurants surrounding the hotel, at night, there are many street food stalls that you can try it out! Staying here, I can experienced the local life of Korean, as part of this area is still very ‘old town’ feel...The room was very nicely designed, cleaned and equipped with very nice amenities. The bed was bit ‘hard’ for me, but the pillows was comfort enough. Overall, it was great. The only comment is about the air-conditioner, whereby during the time that I stayed, the weather was started getting cold, and the hotel has turned on the central heater functions, hence, the air conditioner was unable to function in the room, only heater. Actually, I have no issues to open the window for the fresh and cool air, however, the only downside was during the night time, there were lots of street stalls that operated till late night, bit noisy if I open the window, but feel stuffy if I didn’t open the window, since only heater is turning on...Would like to kudus to the hotel front desk staff, Ally, that provided me all the useful information and assistance. She spoke very good English and was really helpful, tried her best to assist me on everything, included the heater issues, though the issue was not fixed, but I can still feel the efforts she put... She makes me feel good! Furthermore, when I asked for some recommendations on the local food, she not just verbally told, but even printed out the map, circled out the exact restaurant and translated to the English as well. Her kind assistance is greatly appreciated.All in all, I still having positive experiences while stayed with Makers :)","November 3, 2017","25    Makers Hotel

1434,"Before arrival, I sent an email to request for early check-in but there was no reply at all. When I arrived at 10am on the day itself, sure enough I was rejected for check-in. The receptionist told me that they had received my email but I had to come back at 12pm to check on availability. If only they had replied my email beforehand, I would have made other arrangement!! The terrible experience continued because when I came back to the hotel at 12.45pm, the same receptionist continued to tell me that no room is available and I can come back at 3pm which is the normal check in time. I was obviously exhausted but he did not give any alternatives or show any empathy. I had to suggest to pay an extra night in order to get a room immediately. I am a business traveler and had meetings to attend in the afternoon. The whole poor communication continued with him not understanding my request at all and telling me that they give me a complimentary upgrade which cost 50,000won. Is that even complimentary? I was nevertheless eager to pay and end my misery. When I clarified if 50,000won was for the whole stay, he led me to believe so but eventually, I was presented with a bill of 110,000won, i.e. 50,000won is for per night BEFORE TAX.

1445,"I chose this hotel because I wanted convenience and easy access from/to Incheon airport because I had tight schedule and this hotel has a stop for the airport limousine bus. I really did not expect much, I just wanted convenience and zero hassle on my escape from everyday work life. lMy return flight was quite early so I needed to take the first bus that is scheduled at 4:42. I checked out at 4:30 AM and waited at the bus stop that is located right outside the lobby. A bus came at 4:40 AM but it’s written Gangnam/COEX so I was not completely sure it was the bus to the airport, and it didn’t stop, and then some staff came out from the lobby making an X sign with his hands to the bus driver so it left. Then I waited a few minutes but no bus came so I asked those staff that made the X sign whether the bus that came earlier was the bus to the airport and IT WAS!! I was so shocked. The staff told me that he searched the lobby beforehand and he found no one so that was why he made the X sign. Okay, so I was wrong because I waited at the bus sign outside the lobby -not inside-. I ended up having to take a taxi in order to reach the airport in time. So I had to pay for the taxi (it’s expensive) and of course I lost the money I paid for airport limousine bus ticket. I felt so regretful at my return journey like I wish I told the staff I needed to catch the bus, or I wish I waited inside the lobby instead of diligently waited at the bus stop, or I wish I just run screaming “airport???” to the bus driver.Other than my regretful return journey experience, other stuff is okay, maybe average. Room is fine, it’s clean, sometimes I heard noises from outside at night, but it wasn’t a problem. I could sleep well. I didn’t use any facilities because that was not my purpose of staying here. There are alot of convenience stores around it’s easy to buy stuff you need. Access to the station is okay (7 minutes walk), but there are closer hotels with cheaper rates that I wished I chose since I had to pay for the taxi anyway.Anyway if you decide to stay I guess it’s not a bad choice but I do recommend you to proactively ask / talk to the staff in order to receive great service. I read another review here that says he did not get anyone welcoming him when he arrived and it was true, the check-in receptionist was the first person I talk to after I dragged my suitcase to the desk. And since I ended up paying much more for the taxi I wish I used that money to stay at a more expensive hotel nearer the station that also has the airport bus stop because I saw a staff waiting outside the lobby to get your suitcase, so maybe I didn’t have to experience such regretful return journey just because I didn’t say hi to the concierge.","April 13, 2019","26    Novotel Ambassador Seoul Gangnam

Room service pricing seemed to be somewhat high. The first day I had a small bottle of Pellegrino water at the hotel cafe, and was charged around USD10. Later I was told by locals that this is pretty much standard in Korean hotels. Regardless to say, I became a regular of a nearby cafe that offered “normal” prices.

1457,You can take airport but from Incheon airport to this hotel easily (the bus will arrive at Lobby). While the hotel is not too far from subway (Sinnonhyeon exit 4). The hotel has big gym which provide sport wear for you (just take only sneaker) also with indoor swimming pool (have to take your own swimming suit). But the sauna and shower - require extra charge (which I think the hotel should not charge on this).The room is not big and still heard some noise from beside the room. ,"January 13, 2019","26    Novotel Ambassador Seoul Gangnam

It was start of winter and they had switched off the air conditioning. Room was extremely stuffy and hot. So we were left with 2 options. They could bring a fan or we could open the windows. We decided to open the windows. The street noise was quite unbearable. With people shouting til 5am each day. The comfortable beds were with questioned but could not really rest well wit h the noise.

1460,"My son fell very ill on the 3rd day of my family vacation and he needed to see a doctor urgently. Mr Daniel Baek of Guests Relations personally brought us to a clinic nearby and helped us with the translation when the doctor was examining my son as I do not speak Korean. He helped us collect the medication from the pharmacy and sent the medicine to my room. In addition, I had to cancel my skiing plans to Alpensia and he helped me handle the room extension as well as the cancellation of the bookings at Alpensia. Throughout the whole episode, he was caring and patient, always assuring us that things will be ok. My family is very thankful to Daniel for going the extra mile and he definitely did a big part in saving our vacation from becoming a total disaster. Besides Daniel, I met many others in the concierge team who helped me call up clinics, hospitals, and many other things to help make my stay comfortable and easier. I congratulate the hotel for putting together such a great service team and the management must be doing something right. Lastly, I would like to say a big Thank You again to Mr Daniel Baek.

The gym was also large, clean and well equipped, visited mostly by locals who are members of the hotel's health club.However, I was unimpressed by the lukewarm showers (even after a room change) and gaps in the service. For example, I was offered a welcome drink for Accor Plus members at the check in counter (instead of being offered a drink voucher), which turned out to be a gimmicky syrup in a shot glass. The TV controls were also entirely in Korean with no user guide, which made it very difficult to watch any television - a pity considering that the hotel had smart TV.

Staff Training 이 엄청 잘 되어있고 친절함 (1) 조식 뷔페가 오전 6시부터 여서 편안함. 6시 반 보다 훨씬 편리 Buffet Breakfast from 6 am at Square restaurant. 6 am opening of Square restaurant is very convenient, a lot better than 6 30 am opening. Novotel Gangnam appeared to be Air France Air attendant hotel. Early in the morning, many Air France Air attendants are having breakfast at Square restaurant. (2) Executive floor hotel room fridge items are free of charge (beer, 2 bottles of mineral water, sparkling mineral water, Lemonade, nuts, orange juice etc. (3) Easy access to Incheon/ domestic airports . Incheon Airport Limousine Bus directly goes from Novotel Gangnam to Incheon Airport (50 minutes - 1 hour 10 minutes/ when there is no terrible traffic jam) Airport Limousine Bus route had been changed and the time to the airport shortened. (2) Recently I found an alternative way. I check in my check in baggage at CALT (City Airport Service) located in Samsung-dong. I catch airport Limousine from CALT . It takes around 15 mins from Novotel Gangnam to CALT by taxi. The advantage of this way is that I can get seat number early + already check- in baggage at CALT. This way can substantially save time at the airport, avoiding a long queue at Incheon Airport.(3) From subway station (Line number 9) - direct line to domestic airport (4) VIP Lounge on Level 16 Happy Hour dish quality is very good. Many people have dinners there with free good selection of red/ white wine/ champagne, beer, sparkling mineral water, nuts, cheese etc as well as small buffet style dishes selection (5 pm - 7 pm). (5) Mr David Jung/ Front Senior Manager is excellent - professional + trustworthy character + commitment to guests & to Novotel Gangnam Hotel.Cons: Walking from the nearest subway station, it takes around 5 - 8 mins, but it is uphill. With carriers, it is a bit tired. I prefer to catch a taxi from the Station. Taxi fare is around $ 3.","July 30, 2018","26    Novotel Ambassador Seoul Gangnam

I was regularly interacting with the staff, never to complain though, and it’s really a great place to stay. I travelled with my two sons (18 and 11years).I mentioned to a manager at reception that I did not get a view from my room and next day we were moved to a higher floor with great views.My special thanks to Irene at Concierge. She is very kind and knows her stuff. She had ideas for things to do and gave good directions, talking to the taxi drivers for us in Korean where needed. When my 11 year old dropped his iPhone 7 in a taxi, she did everything to help us although the taxi driver claimed he did not find it. A tip: always get the receipt from the taxi driver. His telephone number is on it and you can call if you leave anything in the car. In our case we didn’t do this but Irene used our credit card details to trace the driver. What a girl! The others at the concierge were equally nice and helpful.We used the restaurant at lobby level and bought cake from the snack bar next to it. All was great. Room Service was a good choice and tasty. The Square restaurant I found a nice place to eat but probably expensive. There was an issue with cancelling my deposit but another manager stepped in and sorted it out. I like these managers and the fact that can actually make decisions. A walk down the hill to the left of the hotel takes you to the stations. It’s a nice shopper’s walk to Gangnam station. A walk to the right is pleasant in the evening and if you go far enough you’ll arrive at the COEX.

Although there is free water, a kettle, in room wifi, slippers and bathrobes. Also no Minibar but this is not an issue for me. Aircon was very good too. The TV had 2 English channels & 28 Korean channels. So bring your own movie/TV entertainment... The mattresses were a bit hard and the pillows too soft but neither caused me too much stress as we were so tired after each day's activities. An issue that was a deal breaker was the glass shower stall that leaked water all across the floor. It was dangerous after 2 people had showered and we had to put towels down to walk safely.... Not nice to walk on soggy cold towels and quite unhygienic. To their credit, when I mentioned the shower the next day to reception, the staff quickly offered to switch us to another room and let us inspect it first for suitability. We switched rooms to one with a bath tub & basic plastic shower curtain. The only other minor grip is that the square shallow sinks leave water all over the counter top.Staff were friendly and helpful. Spoke good English. They were very nice and provided great service. Extra towels were never a problem and always delivered quickly. We had a wifi issue in the second room and someone arrived to fix it within 5 minutes.Overall we stayed the full 7 nights since it was clean... Just not up to the standards of other 4 star hotels I've stayed in. It's 3.5 stars at best.Is an adequate hotel. But I wouldn't stay here unless I got a fantastic deal.

1493,"There are 2 Ramada hotels in Seoul. One is located in Dongdaemun called Ramada Seoul Dongdaemun, and the other Ramada Hotel & Suites by Wyndham Seoul Namdaemun. Check in and check out is fast and did not require a deposit. They allow late check out until 1pm. Charge 24,200 Korean Won/hr until 5pm. Incheon Airport Bus stops right in front of the hotel every 30 minutes but stops operating at 6:50pm. If your plane is arriving past 7pm until early hours you will have to take the night bus located just outside the airport gates. The night bus drops you off at Lotte Mall beside City Hall, 20-30 minute walking distance to the hotel. We were told not to worry about homeless people sleeping on the streets during wee hours. It feels safe to walk around Seoul.The hotel interior and room is quite dated but serviceable. The lobby sofas are badly creased but comfortable, room aircon cold and can be adjusted accordingly. Wifi in room is free and very fast. Bed is old, sags in the middle but still comfortable. The 2 pillows provided were both too soft for me.Not much of a view too. Hotel receptionists are pleasant and helpful, speaks little English. Bring your own toothbrush but other amenities are provided. I suggest you bring your own slippers as the tiled floor gets cold and slippers provided are not the disposable ones. They seem to have been used by many other prior guests, mine has a heel indent. Note that during winter the aircon is turned off (December to February) verify months with hotel to be sure.There is a Coffee Bean at the lobby but it is close holidays and Sundays. The hotel has a restaurant at the 24th floor and local restaurants at the basement all of which closes at 8pm, closed holidays and Sundays. There are 3 convenient stores right outside, a Subway, a Starbucks ,2 local bars and some local eatery around the corner that remain open until late.Ramada Nandaemun is a 10 minute walk to Nandaemun market. Most shops and restaurants close at 6-8pm but street vendors remain open selling food and other wares stay open. There is a place in Nandaemun market that stay open late called Food alley. Always a taxi on standby outside Ramada in case you are too tired to walk or going far. Subways station is walking distance. Other places of interest such as Insadong, Gwanghamun Gate, Bukchon (which are all near each other) is also nearby.Do not expect luxury and great ambience. It is a not-so convenient place to sleep and rest.","June 12, 2019","27    Ramada Hotel & Suites by Wyndham Seoul Namdaemun

1501,"Stayed in this hotel 1 week on a business visit. The hotel was absolutely spotless, fine room with a kitchen and a washing machine and kettle but no dishes or cutlery, which was a bit strange. Bathroom was very clean with a good shower - towels could have been a bigger but absolutely spotlessly clean and cleaned everyday. TV had a good choice of English movies and there was an electric adaptor supplied. Overall this hotel was very satisfactory. Close to the train station and the shuttle service that goes to the airport. It is clearly a banking area so there are lots of coffee shops and places to sit It is also conveniently located to the market area which is close by. Breakfast was very good with a spectacular view from the 25th floor the Sky Lounge and at 19 won it was good value for money and set you up for the whole day. There is no bar area the hotel just a coffee shop in the main reception so they don't do any of food other than breakfast but there is a number of good choice eateries below the hotel in the food court with many different small restaurants all serving different types of Korean food from as little as 7 won.

Their staff had been super friendly and helpful throughout my stay. Special mention to manager Sky Song who greeted us when we were having breakfast and offered to let us have a humidifier in our room upon knowing that my baby son had flu. She also accompanied us to see the doctor there when we were unwell so that she could translate for us. Emily was also very prompt in attending to my requests e.g. baby bath tub before we arrived.

We also brought a travel crib with us and there was plenty of space for that in the room.The daily breakfast was appreciated and variety was sufficient. The dining room has highchairs, kid dishes and cutlery, and most days staff kindly brought us a pack of wipes to use (we didn’t ask and had our own).We made use of the laundry facilities. The dryer worked well but we had a lot of clothes the needed to hang dry and those dried well in the bathroom with the fan on (we bring a travel laundry line with us).Surprisingly, we didn’t use the play space - just a matter of timing of our days and travel plans. We did make use of the second floor lounge a few days when our toddler was fussy - we grabbed food for lunch and ate in the lounge avoiding pre-nap restaurant meltdowns.The staff were friendly and management seemed sincerely interested in how guests were enjoying their stay.The tax refund documentation (provided as we booked directly) was great to get and it was easy to process the refund at the airport.I would be happy to return to Metro Hotel (with or without kids).","May 25, 2019","28    Metro Hotel

1553,"My family stayed 6 nights with Metro. I didn’t book direct, although if you do you get a few extra perks - like breakfast and you can reclaim the taxes. We arrived 45 mins before allowed check-in (3pm) but wasn’t an issue.Our room was delightful - clean, roomy, temp was to our liking, bedding and beds were comfortable. I’ve never really enjoyed instant coffee but I didn’t mind the brand they provided as well as complimentary bottle water daily (based on room headcount). We didn’t utilize any of the additional facilities in the hotel such as the gym, laundry room, etc. but it was nice to have them available. The entire hotel staff, during our stay, was exceptional. They were courteous, polite, helpful and spoke English (speak slower at times). They helped with questions around the subway/metro system, purchasing of t-cards (highly recommend) and arranging transportation to the airport. The only reason I’m not giving them a 5 star was due to the fact that our room was on next to the utility closet and wow was it loud and at breaking dawn. There was also a constant, faint smell of smoke. Perhaps it was due to us being on the third floor and the smoking lounge was on the second. We also had a very obnoxious family above us that obviously refused to tame their toddler from using the floor as a trampoline. Apparently they’ve never heard of “inside voices”. But that is to no fault of the hotel and I didn’t bother calling the front desk to report. It was our last few nights so we dealt with it. Let’s end on a positive - LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION!!! Everything within walking distance - shops, food, subway/transportation- I mean it was ideal. It wasn’t ever really loud outside from the traffic or crowds. This was the perfect spot and will more than likely be returning due to the pleasant experience. ","March 19, 2019","28    Metro Hotel

You can also walk from the hotel to Myeongdong Station that takes about 10 minutes.2) There is Starbucks, 7-11, famous BBQ Pig restaurant (Hanam Pig House) and Two Two fried chicken restaurant right in/beside the hotel.

All amenities in the room were sufficient (such as pillows, hangers etc.). Everything was comfortable.7) We have also breakfast in the hotel at Level 9. However, the area for us to dine in is quite small and throughout my 5 days there for breakfast, it was always packed with people and so sometimes you may not be able to sit with your family members or you may have to wait for other guests to finish their breakfast. For me, I think that small area for breakfast does not seem large enough to accommodate to the large number of guests (especially at the peak period for breakfast). Also, the dishes there seem repetitive and the choices are limited (always the same food). Nonetheless, it is still enough for you to start your day. The mochi bread (made by the hotel) are really nice, so do try this when you are staying there. The staff at the breakfast counter are polite and helpful.8) Overall, the stay at Metro Hotel was pleasant and I would come back to this hotel again.

The bed was so soft as well as the pillows. My mom and I loved sleeping in it. I wish there were more cable channels though. The breakfast items were delicious although the same every two days. We love the sausage and chocolate croissant. Oh, and the coffee too! The location of this hotel is the best part. It is just two a minute away from Euljiro-il ga station and less than minutes away from Myeongdong station. This part of Myeongdong is quiet but in just a few steps, you’ll get to be in the noisy and lively part of Myeongdong. Lotte Young is also very near. The bus stops are also near. If you want to take a taxi, the guard at the lobby will definitely help to get one. Note that it is kinda hard to get a normal taxi in Seoul as some taxi drivers are not fluent in English.","October 5, 2018","28    Metro Hotel

Hotel is also very near subway and right smack in Myeongdong.Room is spacious and chambermaid does an excellent job in keeping the room clean everyday. Just a side note, would have been even more ideal if they can vacuum the room more frequently since ours is a week's long stay.Breakfast is also provided daily. Simple fare so nothing to rave about but kitchen staff is always around to ensure food is replenished.Staff are mostly friendly and helpful and most can speak good English.

There have been major renovation done since we last stayed. The hotel has improved a lot since. Reception is on the 9th floor along with the breakfast area. This time, we stayed at the family twin room. The rooms are big. Bathroom is big too with a separate shower and bath tub. Location is excellent. Near the Myeongdong shopping area. This hotel is very near the restaurants that sells fried chicken! :) This is not a cheap hotel but I guess it's fairly priced. Staffs are friendly as well especially the security guards manning the front door. There is a 7-11 and starbucks within the building as well.

I wasn't expecting too much as the photos on booking.com don't do it justice but I was pleasantly surprised.I got there very late as my flight from Shanghai was delayed by quite a few hours and the door/concierge had my key card for me and was very helpful and all of them friendly.The room was very clean, comfortable and efficient. They have a mobile phone called a ""handy"" that is fully charged to use for your entire stay. You can make local and some international calls on it and the Google maps is a godsend.The breakfast was simple but delicious, fresh baked bread and other continental bits.The subway is very nearby so it's an ideal position to get around Seoul.I really enjoyed staying there and plan to return in Oct when I am back (price dependent).I would highly recommend this hotel.","August 29, 2018","28    Metro Hotel

1576,"My husband and I stayed at the Metro Hotel in June for a week and it was a pleasant experience. The room itself wasn't as big as what we are used to but we knew that prior to going that a lot of the hotel rooms can be smaller than average. Despite the size, the room was clean, fresh and catered to our needs. The rooms had complimentary water, tea and coffee, and also a fridge which was really handy. The best part was the complimentary smart phone provided in each room to make local calls and take out when exploring. It was great to book tickets for excursions on too! Breakfast was lovely. Simple but had everything what you could want in the morning. Toast, cereal with nuts and dried fruit, pastries, egg, tea/coffee, juice and they also had some of the Korean breakfast items which was good to try such as porridge, dumplings and soup.Free massage chair to use in the main lobby which was nice after a tiring day sightseeing.Fantastic location - we didn't need a taxi once and everyone was in walking distance. From supermarkets, shops, places to eat and drink and to the main metro/bus stations.On our last day, we missed breakfast due to our airport transfer so the hotel gave us a little bag with pastries and juice - lovely touch!Highly recommend!","July 27, 2018","28    Metro Hotel

The room is big enough to accommodate the 3 of us. The toilet is clean with smart heated toilet seat. Would definitely stay again and recommend this hotel!Tip: if you book your room through their official website you get a complimentary breakfast and a tax refund. Going to Seoul South Korea? 1. Book your room direct to the official website of hotels that offer tax refund. 2. Stay in Myeongdong area3. Check if airport shuttle bus or airport limousine (KAL bus) bus stop is near your hotel of choice or if your hotel is included in the airport shuttle bus route.

However, there is some noise (we was on the 3rd floor) from people smoking outside the restaurants opposite the hotel and as previously stated some of the rooms are very small. Other issues we had was noisy neighbours heard through extremely thin walls. I suppose what I was disappointed about is on our first morning, we told the duty manager that our fridge door was literally falling off, she was extremely apologetic (not that she needed to be) and assured us it would be fixed (A small job, tightening of a screw), yet this did not get fixed for the duration of our stay.

The hotel is located at thje intersection of Myeongdong 9ga-gil and Myeongdong 3ga-gil (see photo). The closest access to walking from Euljiro 1(il)-ga metro station is via Myeongdong 3ga-gil which is between Hyundai Motors building and Starbucks on either side of the road, leading from exit 5 of the station. Although it is difficult to navigate with luggage, the fastest and the cheapest access from either Gimpo or the other airport is by Arex express train with one interchange (to Line 2) at Hongik University Station. The hotel is also located within walking distance to major Department Stores such as Lotte and others. The hotel is also located near many underground shopping areas associated with three metro stations scattered around the area. There are also many quality restaurants , eateries and street food vendors within walking distance from the hotel. Amenities: There is a small Gym with a treadmill, weight machine and a Cross Trainer with two televisions. The Room had a small fridge and coffee making facilities. It had a security deposit box, and a hair dryer. There is also a laundry and dryer facilities (with self cash payment, detergent dispensers) and free ironing facilities in the 7th floor. Wi-Fi system worked very well. The Television had Korean, BBC and CNN services.Reception/Service: The hotel reception is located at the highest level and can be accessed via an lift directly running only to two other floors.

1585,"I stayed in a Family Twin room from 25 - 29 May as my friends strongly recommended this hotel due to the convenient location, cleanliness and friendly service. My daughters like this hotel and we all felt very comfortable staying here. The room is equipped with an air humidifer (it's very helpful to prevent dryness in the room) and an air cooler. However there is room for improvement for air conditioning as sometimes we felt warm even though it was set at 18 degrees as the aircon vent cannot be adjusted. The hotel provides only shampoo, shower gel, toothbrush and toothpaste. It will be great if they provide body lotion too. The coin washer and dryer on 7th floor are easy to use, but there is only one each. Cost KRW3,000 for washing, KRW3,000 for drying, KRW500 for detergent and fabric softener sheet. Breakfast was simple but sufficient. Taxi fare from hotel to Incheon airport cost KRW65,000, hassle free as security was helpful to load all baggages in.

Walking distance to almost all the sites including the Myeongdong Cathedral and subway.

The air conditioner is right smack on top of the bed, and they also provide black circular stickers if the lights coming from the aircond unit annoys you while you sleep. The tv channels aren't much to enjoy since the only English programme is BBC and some other documentary.

There is also a few mart nearby and a 7-11 downstairs for purchasing groceries. Aside Starbucks located on GF, there is also a Coffee join located just right opposite hotel. 2. Breakfast wise - Simple but yet amazing, the croissants and OJ are good! They have alternate menus - if one day its Asian style guests can enjoy congee and japchae (korean stir fry noodle) or rice balls, on the next day bacons might be served. Standard breakfast options (cereal, toast, croissant plus a plate of toufu?) are available all time. 3. Service wise 1- Laundry service located on 7F is open between 8am and 1030pm. Both washing machine and dryer each cost 3000 won. 1 pack (laundry powder plus 1 linen softener for dryer) cost 500 won. You can either use 500 won coins or 1000 won notes only for both machines. There is a notes to coins converting machine in the room which is very handy. The entire cycle from washing to drying takes about an hour plus - about 45 for washing and 30 for dryer. 4. Service wise 2 - Printing facilities available also on lobby 9F. From memory it cost 300 won per A4 page.5. Service wise 3 - The lovely girls at lobby 9F helped us booked a cab to Incheon since we've got an early morning flight - it costed 65,000 won and credit cards accepted. The girls have also helped us booked the Hancook restaurant at N Seoul tower. Hotel lobby on 9F also has T-money available for sale and they also offer top ups (cash only). If you prefer more fancy / cuter T-money card try the 7-11 downstairs ( we got the cute Brown and Cony T- money card there).6. Service wise 4 - Terrace Lounge on 2F. There is microwave available - we've used them a couple of times making cup noodles and it feels good having hot food in winter and this wont stink our room!Ps:1. if could, book directly with the hotel as the rates offered for early birds could beat other third-person websites. As others mentioned, book directly with hotel as they offer complimentary breakfast. We booked our room in late November knowing our travel period might be peak due to the Winter Olympics.2. Ask for a local map during check in. Although the handy phone in the room comes in handy, it is also good to have a hard copy on hand (: 3. There is a foldable luggage rack underneath the bed.

I checked out in the morning but I picked up my luggage from there in the evening (8pm flight) and no one bothered to informed me even though I was back at reception. In the email response, Hotel Manu simply noted that they have found my pouch (contents TBC） and they can’t send it so I’ll need to organise a Fedex myself even though I offered to paid for them to organise it for me. I’m still trying to get specific answers so I can organise the Fedex courier e.g. whether the Fedex courier should come to reception to pick up my items at a specific time. All I got, was that Fedex is an international service(duh!) and I can go online to org one.As you can see in the screen shots of the email comms, they aren’t really helpful or seem to care at all so if you’re looking for a place that will go the extra mile for you when things go wrong, Hotel Manu is not the place to go to.

The room was large enough for two and very comfortable. The people on reception were very helpful and provided me with maps, directions or any other help that I needed.The location is about 10 mins walking from Seoul station, 5 mins walk along the same road to Namdaemun Market and a further 10 mins along the road to Myeongdong shopping district. It is also less than 10 mins walk around the corner to the Seoul City Wall Sungnyemun (Namdeamun) Gate.I would recommend.There are two ways to get to the hotel from the station. The easiest if it is not raining is as follows.Come out of the AREX and go up the escalators to the main station where the KTX is, turn right and walk to Exit Gate 1.You will see a big red building across the road and to the left an overhead walkway over the road.Come out of the exit, go down the escalator to street level and walk across all the zebra crossings towards the red building.When you have no more zebras in front of you (you will be across the road from the red building) turn left, walk towards the overhead bridge and you will come to a zebra at the corner of the red building, and if you look across to the overhead walkway you will see a glass enclosed escalator.Cross the roads, go up the escalator onto the walkway, turn right and walk along about 75 yards and on the left you will see a small bridge from the walkway over the road which leads to the entrance to the hotel reception.If it is raining and you want to use the underpass take Exit Gate 2 and walk about 50 yards following the signs for subway lines 1 and 4.Go down the escalators until you reach the ticket machines and gates and turn left, you need exit 7.Keep walking until you reach a smaller number of ticket machines on your left and just past that there is a tunnel on the right signposted exit 7. Go down there and when you reach a fork go left.When you reach the stairs take the right hand one up to street level.Keep walking straight until you see the overhead bridge leading from the overhead walkway to the hotel and either take the lift up or walk up he stairs.I went back to the station at 5.30am and all the homeless had been moved on, there was none there.","July 5, 2018","29    Hotel Manu

1645,"I had a room on the 4th floor, facing Seullo Terrace. The location was optimal, right down the road from Seoul station with connections to anywhere you would like to go. My room was very comfortable, and I could not hear visitors in the other rooms, so it was quiet too! The staff were wonderful, always so friendly and willing to help me. The hotel is right down the road from Namdaemun Market, which was one of my favourite places to wander around. It was very easy to find the hotel again after wandering through the streets, since it is such a central location.","May 22, 2018","29    Hotel Manu

1646,Love this hotel EXCEPT there is only one electrical outlet in the room far away from the bed. Closest exit at Seoul station is #7 where a lot of homeless sleep later in the night. Construction happening next door as of May 2018 but that didn’t bother us. Bar/Resto on the first floor was happening if you want to fly to Korea to eat pizza. Service was very good. Wine opener at the front desk. Found a nice bottle of cab at the convenience store close by for $13. Starbucks across the street. There is an old overpass that has been turned into a pedestrian walkway to Seoul station with some cool artwork and no homeless. Would stay here again.,"May 12, 2018","29    Hotel Manu

1647,"If you're looking for great location, this one is highly recommended. Just don't expect too much for the hotel itself base on the price, because it is just ordinary, interior room are just simple, and the lobby is small.","May 10, 2018","29    Hotel Manu
